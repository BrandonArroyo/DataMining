While the former Navy SEAL achieved a fair degree of fame before his death in February 2013, the release of the movie based on his book prompted renewed interest in both the events it depicted and other claims Kyle made during his lifetime.\r\n", u'\r\nThree particular incidents Kyle maintained he was involved in have caused the most controversy. They are:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nThe film based on Kyle's book complicated an already tangled narrative, though adaptation of autobiographies to the silver screen frequently invokes creative license. But the rumors that quickly became part of Kyle's legend came not from the book-to-film evolution but rather from the man himself.\r\n", u'\r\nChris Kyle\'s claim he\'d fired upon and killed dozens of "looters" after Hurricane Katrina hit ', u' in 2005 preceded the other two tales. The story circulated through postings on several web sites and through a number of news ', u', as well as being passed from person to person in both the online and offline worlds:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIndeed, the account does not hold water simply on the grounds cited in the passage quoted above. Imagining that SEALs were deployed to ', u' in the chaotic days that followed Katrina is not exceptionally hard, considering the level of disorder that followed the devastation wrought by the hurricane. But the notion that dozens of Americans were shot dead on mere suspicion of (relatively minor) crimes, on American soil and with the full support of a system of law that otherwise does not allow for such summary \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\npunitive actions, challenges credulity to a very large degree. Moreover, thirty or so bodies of local residents slain in such a manner never turned up as corroborative evidence of such a claim. The circumstance Kyle claimed would have required the silence and compliance of all witnesses, the families of the dead, all involved law enforcement agencies, and untold others who might have become aware of killings meted out under inarguably public circumstances. Had Kyle and his fellows truly dispatched such a large number of looters or "residents who were contributing to the chaos" (who had neither been charged with nor convicted of any crime, much less a capital one), some other evidence of this tale would have emerged. One person disappearing under such circumstances is unusual; thirty or so is truly unbelievable.', u'\r\n\r\nThe second claim involved a similar measure of street justice purportedly meted out by Kyle to what many would deem deserving recipients. In that tale, Kyle was nearly the victim of a carjacking at a gas station, but the deadly sniper was quicker than his would-be assailants: he drew and fatally wounded the unnamed men. \r\n', u'\r\nThe story got odder, though, when police responded to the situation (in some accounts, Kyle called for intervention from the Department of Defense; in others, police discovered his special privileges when they checked his identification and received a mysterious message in response).  An ', u' of the rumor was promulgated by a ', u' news outlet after the release of ', u', in which both the claims made by Kyle and their built-in lack of verifiability were questioned:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe most pervasive version of the rumor stemmed from a ', u' article on a Dallas-based web site that referenced a very loose definition of the word "confirmed." According to the site, Kyle and some unnamed officers in the area in which the incident purportedly occurred (never directly specified), stated security camera footage of the incident existed and/or they had spoken to an individual who\'d viewed the footage. But no footage matching the description provided by Kyle on the site in question has ever turned up, certainly an unusual circumstance in the wake of the large amount of attention Kyle and the film ', u' have garnered:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe site added some telltale markers of a genuine urban legend:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAll involved had heard the story, and some of them claimed to know of a person who had seen the purported ', u" all of them heard the story from the same source (Kyle himself), and none of them could personally attest to having viewed the alleged security camera footage.  And just as in the Superdome sniping tale, the putative victims remain unidentified even now, so no one can possibly verify whether they're even dead, much less the circumstances under which they died.\r\n", u"\r\nWhile those claims were both extraordinary and by their very nature difficult to corroborate, the third was both a bit more high-profile and (eventually) involved a celebrity. In his autobiography, Kyle described a moment of defending the honor of SEALs against someone who'd impugned them at an unimaginably inappropriate time: while they were mourning the loss of a fellow SEAL at a bar:\r\n \r\n", u"\r\n\r\nYet again, the story eventually developed another intriguing twist when Kyle elaborated upon it during a 2012 appearance on Fox News channel's ", u". During that segment, Kyle claimed the previously unnamed individual he described was none other than Jesse Ventura, the former professional wrestler, governor of Minnesota, and member of the Navy's Underwater Demolition Teams during the Vietnam War era.\r\n", u"\r\nWhile the claims about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the carjacking incident were met with some general disbelief, the mention of Ventura's name introduced a separate credibility issue for Kyle in the form of a lawsuit filed by Ventura against Kyle after the latter's appearance on O'Reilly's show. After Kyle died in 2013 the suit continued against his estate, and a jury eventually found Kyle's estate had improperly profited from claims made by the decedent that had no basis in provable fact and awarded Ventura ", u' dollars in damages:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nHowever, it should be noted the jury in the case did not specifically have to determine whether Kyle had in fact punched out Ventura (for whatever reason) in order to find in favor of the plaintiff, and its verdict may not have been unanimous:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nSo while Chris Kyle\'s historical legacy as one of America\'s most lethal snipers in foreign wars is largely confirmed and corroborated, his claims about various "take charge" incidents in the U.S. are lacking in substantiation. No record of any shooting deaths matching the description of Kyle\'s purported carjacking victims has ever surfaced, nor has anyone produced the supposed security camera video of the incident (or even evidence such a video truly exists). ', u" authorities did not log some thirty unaccounted-for shooting deaths in the wake of Hurricane Katrina; and even if Kyle's claim proved in any way plausible, the government-sanctioned street execution of American citizens on American soil without due process would have prompted a large-scale civil rights scandal.\r\n", u"\r\nMoreover, the single claim of this group that stood a legal test of its veracity failed: Kyle's claims about Jesse Ventura were sufficiently non-provable that a jury (deliberating in a country that, by and large, holds a large measure of respect and pursuant leeway for American servicemen) saw fit to award damages to Ventura totaling seven figures, even with the knowledge that Kyle himself hadn't lived to see the sanction and the damages would be levied against his widow and other beneficiaries of his estate.\r\n", u'\r\n', u' \xa0 23 January 2015\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

More important, this claim about missing records is not true: entries for at least four of the Challenger crewmembers can easily be found in SSDI searches:   \r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nAll in all, we have four Challenger astronauts who looked somewhat like persons with similar names who are living today, two Challenger astronauts who looked like their siblings, and one Challenger astronaut who apparently didn\'t look like anyone else bearing the same name.

Proponents of such laws maintain that enhanced regulations requiring voters to display current and valid (photo) identification prior to casting ballots are necessary to prevent widespread voter fraud and ensure the integrity of the election process.  Opponents maintain that actual instances of voter fraud are rare and that such laws only serve to disenfranchise many legitimate voters who, although eligible to vote, have difficulty meeting the enhanced ID requirements. (Currently, thirty states require prospective voters to produce some form of photo or ', u' identification prior to their casting ballots.)\r\n', u'\r\nOne of the arguments mustered by opponents of voter ID laws is the fact that prior to World ', u' it was quite common for women in the \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nU.S. to give birth ', u' rather than in hospitals.  Under those circumstances, the process of recording a birth and obtaining state certification of it was often delayed (rather than occurring within a day or two of the event, as it typically is now), and in many cases no paperwork was ever filed at all, particularly in states that had not yet enacted requirements for mandatory registration of birth certificates. Thus, quite a few people born in the ', u' era may not ever have been issued official birth certificates, documentation which is now generally the starting place for obtaining state-issued photo identification of the type that might be required under voter ID laws.\r\n', u'\r\nOne example of this argument being proffered on the Internet in July 2012 was that Ronald Reagan, the ', u" Governor of California and President of the United States, was born at home (in 1911) and didn't receive his birth certificate until 1991, and therefore he would have been unable to vote for most of his life under current voter ID laws.

(It should be noted with the exception of nasally administered flu vaccines, most vaccines are still dispensed through far more unwieldy syringes.) Central to the rumors were a single YouTube video described as a "leaked Pentagon presentation" and a link to a website on which those plans were purportedly detailed.', u'\r\n\r\nThe article explained while these claims have circulated since at least 2011 (the date of the video\'s publication on YouTube), an increase in "medical police state" activity had enabled people to "connect the dots" about the covert deployment of this mind control vaccine:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe video that supposedly exposed the FunVax plot has been circulating the Internet since at least 2011, yet no event or circumstance has validated the claims made in or about it since its first appearance, and recent interest in the clip came about solely through its "discovery" by ', u'. The document appended as supplemental proof to the long-circulating video [', u'] is hosted on wanttoknow.info, a site devoted to discussion and dispersal of conspiracy-related material. While legitimate documents can and do sometimes emerge through what appear initially to be unreliable channels, no source is given for this "quarterly FunVax report" dated to June 2007.

While it's possible a separate source disseminated the video as Harper endeavored to fund and film his documentary, there's also no compelling evidence any information about FunVax originated from a source other than Harper himself.", u"\r\n\r\nAs for that video, it too has provoked skepticism even among those who've not examined the source of the claims. All identifying details (such as date and context) were supplied by its original poster, and the low resolution of the footage makes it difficult to determine whether the audio portion was tacked on to an extant video from another source entirely.", u'\r\n\r\nUltimately, those objections are secondary to the logistically and scientifically implausible aspects of the FunVax rumor. First and foremost, while the "God gene" is a popular bit of pop science, it isn\'t ', u' by any peer-reviewed evidence:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIn short, the FunVax rumor originated largely with a filmmaker who sought to create a documentary of the same name about the "FunVax conspiracy." The only evidence supporting the rumor is a YouTube video of questionable veracity and an unsourced document that purportedly describes the project. The entire concept of FunVax (which was supposedly already secretly developed, produced, and tested on unwitting Americans) hinged on a "God gene" theory that has yet to pass peer review or yield any known applications. Furthermore, this unproven gene theory supposedly inspired a wide-scale vaccination program involving technologies heretofore unseen in all other areas of working medical science. None of these related technologies (including vastly simplified and effective dispensation of vaccines) has ever been applied or even piloted in any areas of science or medicine before, and are so covert they are virtually unknown in documented pharmaceutical technology. Taken alone, these objections would cast the rumor into the territory of science fiction; all together, it\'s pretty clear the claim is impossible on many levels.', u"\r\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning the FunVax claim may sound slightly familiar to ", u' fans, as it very closely matches the main plot line of the film ', u' (spoiler alert):', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u' \xa0  21 January 2014\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

In the aftermath of the 2012 massacre, several conspiracy theories emerged either claiming the murders did not occur in the way they were reported, or the event was wholly fabricated as a "false flag" attack. Initially the conspiracies orbited a larger concern that strict gun control laws would be introduced, spurred by the widespread grief that ensued from Sandy Hook. Even when the predictions of a gun grab did not come to pass, the conspiracy theories inspired by the fear of it failed to abate.\r\n', u'\r\nWhen the above-displayed image began to circulate, many of what have come to be known as "Sandy Hook truthers" believed it was further evidence a nefarious conspiracy of unexplained origins was at work. Why else would a woman in Pakistan be displaying a picture of Noah Pozner at a vigil for slain Pakistani students who were killed two years after he was?', u'\r\n\r\nOne particularly callous ', u' of the claim approached the quandary as if individuals with eyes and the ability to process visual information could not see for themselves the identical picture was used by the woman in Pakistan:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAnother ', u" of the claim examined whether conspiracy adherents were being taunted via the use of Pozner's image:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nA number of explanations might apply to this puzzling photograph. The first is that an image of Pozner was mistakenly included in the vigil by someone who turned up his picture while performing an online search using a term such as "December school massacre" to find photos of those killed in Peshawar and and did not recognize his face (because he had dark hair and facial features not unlike those of many of the victims in Peshawar). Another is that his image was deliberately included by mourners as an homage in order to publicly link multiple incidents of young, innocent victims\' losing their lives in senseless school shootings.  A third is that a massive worldwide cabal colluded to perpetrate or falsify the murders of more than ', u' and teachers collectively spanning the globe from Connecticut to Pakistan, and the puppeteers of this conspiracy were so inept that they failed the basic task of obtaining novel images to assign to each of the victims of the violent acts. \r\n', u'\r\nIn fact, the second explanation offered above appears to be what happened: On the day of the Peshawar incident a Pakistani woman created a collage of photographs of young people killed in school shootings and posted it to Facebook with the caption "They Went to School and Never Came Back."

Another is the shaky foundation on which the conspiracy theory rests is a matter of some nuance, complicating its initial plausibility. As well, the gravity of the trial's supposed conclusion, when contrasted with the relatively little public discussion of that addendum to King's life, has lent credence to the belief the trial in question and its outcome were deliberately omitted from the news.\r\n", u"\r\nHistorical figures like Martin Luther King, Jr. tend to be the subject of complicated conspiracy theories, particularly when they are vectors for widespread societal change. The man who was charged with King's murder, James Earl Ray, confessed to the crime and pled guilty; he then recanted his confession, hinted at a conspiracy, and sought to withdraw his guilty plea and secure a trial. However, any claim made by Ray about his guilt or innocence should be weighed against his strong incentive to be freed from prison (where he died in 1998).", u"\r\n\r\nAlso at issue is the difference between Ray's guilty plea in 1969, which avoided his undergoing a criminal trial, and the case cited by the rumors, which was a civil trial heard in 1999. The latter (", u") was a civil suit brought by agents of King's estate (including his widow, Coretta Scott King) against a man named Loyd Jowers, who claimed to have taken part in a conspiracy to assassinate King.  In a criminal trial the guilt of the defendant must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, but in a civil suit the plaintiff need only support his claim with a preponderance of evidence to prevail.\r\n", u"\r\nLoyd Jowers was a Memphis restaurant owner who inserted himself into the narrative about King's death in the course of a 1993 television interview during which he claimed to have been party to a larger conspiracy to assassinate King. However, Jowers had long asserted he had no involvement in the event before suddenly and bizarrely ", u', twenty-five years after the fact,  he had been paid to hire a hit man to kill Martin Luther King.  He then repudiated his claims when required to testify to them under oath:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Justice found Jowers' claims were without merit and explained he'd never been able to provide any support for later assertions about his involvement in King's death:\r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Justice Department's ", u" determined no physical evidence whatsoever supported Jowers' multiple and conflicting accounts of his involvement in King's assassination, and Jowers stood to profit from his assertions:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the jury who heard the case of ', u" (in which the King family was represented by James Earl Ray's former lawyer, William Pepper) returned a ", u' in favor of the plaintiff, holding that Loyd Jowers had participated in a conspiracy to kill King and "governmental agencies" were party to the conspiracy:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nHowever, the verdict was of no real significance given that virtually nothing was at stake (this was not a criminal trial, and the defendant was only being sued for a mere $100 and thus had little motivation for vigorously defending himself), allowing the King family to present a mostly unopposed version of events and guide the jury to return the verdict they desired. As noted in the ', u' Times ', u' of the verdict, the one-sided presentation of the case allowed for no other result:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe Justice Department also found the evidence presented in the civil trial to be lacking in credibility:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAll of this is therefore a very slender thread on which to hang the claim that the "U.S. government was proved responsible for King\'s assassination."  (In the event, the verdict referred only to "governmental agencies" rather than the U.S. government specifically, a term that could include anything from local police to the CIA.)

No other parties (including any branches or agents of the United States Government) were named as defendants in ", u", and no identification was provided by Jowers of the purported other parties with whom he colluded to assassinate King.

In addition, Ebola is only one of a number of hemorrhagic fevers known to medical science and is therefore not a unique horror unleashed on Africa.', u"\r\n\r\nWhile Kwame's suspicions of military intervention in Africa are understandable, they also begin to unravel when the history of Ebola is considered.

The XL1 is in many ways still a concept/prototype vehicle, and so Volkswagen is testing the waters by putting out a limited production run to see how many consumers are really interested in shelling out the equivalent of U.S. $150,000 (not $60,000 as claimed above) for a two-person car.  And the testers at ', u" found that while the XL1's fuel efficiency might be superb, it might also be somewhat overblown as presented in promotional materials:\r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nAs for why only Europe, the answer is that the U.S. does have many safety standards in place (enacted many years ago a variety of reasons, none of which was to keep high-mileage vehicles off the U.S. market) that all automobile manufacturers have to meet in order to legally sell their vehicles in America, regulations that sometimes require manufacturers to modify or retrofit models that were produced for sale under less strict regulations in Europe (or other parts of the world).  If Volkswagen wants to test-market their XL1 in limited quantities, there's no reason for them to expend millions of dollars preparing and certifying those vehicles for U.S. safety standards when they can vend  their small lot of cars just as well in the European market without all the added expense.  As noted by ", u':\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nAnd if one buys into the conspiracy theory that the government and Big Oil are colluding to keep high-mileage vehicles off the U.S. market in order to protect profits from gasoline sales, one has to wonder why those powerful and malevolent entities aren't doing anything to stop Americans from purchasing cars produced by ", u', superbly-performing vehicles that use no gasoline at all yet still deliver premium performance, have great range for electric cars, have received the highest rating of any automobile ever evaluated by ', u', are top-rated for safety even under tougher U.S. standards, but are widely available for purchase in the U.S.:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAs in so many cases, what is attributed to furtive conspiracy is more easily explained away as wishful thinking colliding with the hard, cold realities of economics.\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 14 April 2014\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

Rumors about the imposition of martial law circulate particularly widely after the occurrence of large-scale catastrophes (such as the 9/11 attacks) or in anticipation of troubling times to come (such as the election of a new president, the arrival of the year 2000, or the passage of more stringent gun control laws).  Such rumors generally feature a plot in which the government's plan to impose martial law has been inadvertently revealed through some minor accidental or coincidental incident, typically the discovery of a truck carrying a cargo of road signs which bear wording indicating that martial law is in effect.\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\nWhile the imposition of martial law during times of national emergency is always a distinct yet distant possibility, nothing about the process mandates that signs proclaiming ', u' order of martial law" be erected. A state of martial law is simply declared by the President, after which troops and/or National Guardsmen are deployed to enforce it. As such, if roads need to be closed, standard "Road Closed" signs are erected. It\'s not the presence or absence of a sign that\'s important; it\'s the authority of the armed guy manning the barricade that matters.\r\n', u'\r\nThe more rational among us realize that even if the government had a contingency plan up its sleeve to suspend civil liberties, \r\nnot even Washington bureaucrats would think special road signs needed to be printed up ahead of time to make all this legal. Again, nothing about martial law requires the erection of specific signs to make it ', u' law exists from the moment an authorized government official says it does. And as for the notion that special signs would be needed to communicate this state of affairs to the civilian populace, notices transmitted by television, radio, and the Internet would accomplish this purpose just fine.\r\n', u'\r\nIf roads needed to be closed, ordinary signs announcing such a closure would serve that purpose. Manufacturing special ones would inevitably lead to the government\'s secret plans being found out, as leaks would soon reach the press from those who produced or transported the signs. Better to stockpile a zillion standard "Road Closed" signs than to risk inadvertently announcing what many Americans would see as an unwarranted armed takeover.\r\n', u'\r\nOkay, so if the signs are a ridiculous flourish in this form of rumor, why are they part of the story?\r\n', u'\r\nIt all comes down to plot device. The signs, you see, are the means by which the government\'s evil plan is revealed to the unsuspecting citizenry. If a truck full of "Road Closed" signs spilled its contents, not even the most charismatic rumormonger would be able to convince anyone this was all tied to a federal plot to take over the country. But make them "By Order of Martial Law" signs, and the story now has legs to run on.\r\n', u'\r\n(Revelation by way of written communication turns up in urban legends whenever a device is needed to propel the story forward by way of explaining actions that have taken place.

In his exposition to that assembly, the man known to television viewing audiences as lovable, kindly, yet permanently bemused patriarch ', u' spoke harshly about his \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nperception of the ills affecting black American society. He cited elevated school dropout rates for inner-city black students and criticized low-income blacks for not using the opportunities the civil rights movement has won for them. Blacks, by their unplanned pregnancies, poor parenting, lack of education, non-standard English, counter-culture dress, and involvement in crime, fail the black community as well as themselves, he said.\r\n', u'\r\nThat May 2004 speech has been both praised and condemned, and excerpts from it have been cobbled together (often in forms that rearrange and present them out of context) and circulated on the Internet under titles such as "We Can\'t Blame White People" and "Bill Has Done It Again." \r\n', u'\r\nBill Cosby has not repudiated his controversial pronouncements or attempted to distance himself from them. Instead, he has chosen to expand upon his theme on subsequent occasions and to make himself a spokesperson for black self-empowerment through education and better parenting. In the service of this cause, he has drawn upon his celebrity to make his voice heard; but, unlike many entertainers who take to the soapbox to decry their b\xeates noires, he brings far more to the podium than merely a recognizable face and a fan base. This man who is best known to the world as a comedian holds a doctorate in education. He is also highly regarded in the African-American community, where he and his wife, Camille, are prized for their philanthropy.

The day after, he said in an interview: "It makes no sense to claim that these are things that belong quietly in the black community. We have to figure out how do you get parenting back into the home. This is a problem of epic proportion." Then, in a statement released shortly after the NAACP gala, he made clear his purpose: "I think that it is time for concerned African-Americans to march, galvanize and raise \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nthe awareness about this epidemic, to transform our helplessness, frustration and righteous indignation into a sense of shared responsibility and action." In another interview, he said: "I feel that I can no longer remain silent. If I have to make a choice between keeping quiet so that conservative media does not speak negatively or ringing the bell to galvanize those who want change in the lower economic community, then I choose to be a bell ringer." \r\n', u'\r\nIn July 2004, he again took to the public soapbox to expound upon his thesis. In a speech given at ', u' Jackson\'s Rainbow Coalition/PUSH Coalition conference in Chicago, he said:  "You\'ve got to stop beating up your women because you can\'t find a job, because you didn\'t want to get an education and now you\'re (earning) minimum wage.

Press photographers over the years had sometimes taken advantage of the positioning of the statues to snap "boob in front of the boob" shots (such as a notorious photo of Edwin Meese, Attorney General during President Reagan\'s second term, holding a report on pornography aloft with the partially nude female statue visible behind him).  \r\n', u"\r\nAfter John Ashcroft, the Attorney General during President George W.

The brief video is amusingly stirring the American outrage pot whilst the text is read in a British accent:\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nThe circulating "up to four wives in Michigan" e-mail and the video are framed in a manner calculated to drum up anger amidst taxpayers who might not believe immigrants should be catered to in any language other than English or that polygamous households should receive additional benefits to support a lifestyle which U.S. law does not recognize or allow.\r\n', u"\r\nIt's important to note that a number of issues are threaded together in the ", u' piece. First of all, it is true that some state and municipal government agencies in Michigan (such as the state Electronic Benefit Transfer program, whose phone number is listed in the example above) provide phone services and printed material in Arabic.  However, this phenomenon is hardly surprising, as Michigan is home to a large ', u' of immigrants from Middle Eastern countries (over 115,000 as of the end of 2013), nor is it unique: plenty of government offices throughout the U.S. provide information and services in ', u' languages other than Spanish (e.g., Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Haitian Creole) in areas where significant numbers of speakers of those languages reside. \r\n', u'\r\nAs for the claim about Muslim men claiming public assistance benefits for up to four wives, one must consider\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nthe plausibility of the situation proposed and understand that the circumstances span multiple issues including marriage, immigration, and the range of benefits commonly dubbed "welfare" in America.\r\n', u"\r\nWhile marriage laws have been modified in some states to include same-sex couples, plural marriages (i.e., more than two spouses) are still not legally sanctioned in any state. It's common knowledge that many families do engage in polygamous or polyamorous household arrangements, but only one partner can be legally recognized as a spouse in such circumstances.\r\n", u'\r\nThe claims made in the e-mail rely on the belief that immigrating to America (or claiming asylum) is a simple process, with many new entrants flowing across our porous borders each year. However, getting into the United States for the sole purpose of taking up residency here is not so easy, and relatively few who make their way here are afforded the opportunity to permanently reside in the U.S.\r\n', u'\r\nFor starters, ', u' a spouse for an immigrant visa is a complicated (and often lengthy) process, one that requires the applying party to have (or have access to) a specified minimum amount of resources before immigration officials approve the non-resident spouse\'s visa application. The process can take months or years, and many lovelorn husbands and wives find their petitions initially rejected.  On top of that, U.S. Department of State regulations specifically state that "In cases of polygamy, only the first spouse may qualify as a spouse for immigration," so nobody is bringing multiple wives into the United States from far-flung lands via immigrant visas.\r\n', u'\r\nShould a hopeful foreigner be lucky enough to legally emigrate to the U.S. and obtain the necessary visa for a spouse, he or she had to have supplied proof of ability to support that spouse. But if one or both parties should fall upon hard times afterwards, all involved are subject to standard assistance eligibility guidelines to qualify for services such as a SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid, or temporary cash assistance.\r\n', u'\r\nIn order to receive these forms of assistance in Michigan, all residents (Muslim or not) must meet basic ', u', among which are that they are must be either U.S. citizens or have "acceptable alien status."  As a representative of the Michigan Department of Human Services told us, although immigrants may bring and/or sponsor relatives (e.g., spouses, children, parents, siblings) for permanent residency or citizenship in the U.S., they cannot claim multiple wives as relatives for that purpose because U.S. law does not recognize plural marriages. \r\n', u'\r\nNothing codified in the law says that "Muslim men are allowed to have as many as ', u' and sign them all up "for welfare and other free government programs."  Although a Muslim man (or any other man) might live in a polygamous relationship after taking up residency in Michigan, he may only legally claim one wife as his ', u' cannot simply list additional (not legally recognized) wives as members of an "extended household" and claim public assistance benefits for them on that basis. Those other "wives" would have to qualify for immigration/residency status (if they were immigrants to the U.S.) and apply for public assistance benefits on their own (as single mothers or heads of households), independent of their status as "unofficial" wives or household members of someone already residing in Michigan. \r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 24 March 2015\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n'] @@@

And even immigrant rights groups are split over whether the "Day Without Immigrants" scheme is a good idea, fearing that having supporters risk their jobs and grades would be counterproductive and could create a chaotic backlash that might serve to antagonize the anti-immigrant movement.\r\n', u'\r\nThe counter-protest suggested in the message quoted at the head of this page ', u' non-immigrants to go out and buy something on the "Day Without Immigrants" ', u' one possible way of blunting the effect of the boycott, but its potential efficacy is also difficult to assess.

Roosevelt and implemented in 1935.  Arguments regarding how the system should be used, administered, and ', u' even whether it should exist at ', u' been the subject of debate for many decades now.  In this vein, the above-quoted item seeks to enumerate (and assign blame for) alterations to Social Security that have supposedly betrayed the intent of the system as originally conceived back in the 1930s.  Most of the entries contained therein, however, are inaccurate regarding what changes were made and/or who was responsible for making them:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThere was no provision in the Social Security Act of 1935 (nor has there ever been any provision) for the payment of Social Security payroll taxes (now commonly \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nknown as ', u', from an acronym for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act) \r\nto be voluntary.  Since the inception of the Social Security program, the law has required that payroll taxes for persons working at jobs covered by Social Security "shall be collected by the employer of the taxpayer by deducting the amount of the tax from the wages as and when paid."\r\n', u'\r\nIt is true that Social Security provisions originally  ', u' only to "workers in commerce and industry (except railroads) under age 65 in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii, and on American vessels," and thus those who worked in fields not designated as "commerce and industry" (e.g., government workers, farm workers, doctors, lawyers) neither paid into the Social Security fund nor received benefits from it.  Nearly all of those exemptions have been since phased out.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nSocial Security taxes were never limited to the first $1,400 of annual income, nor was there any provision in the Social Security Act of 1935 to permanently fix the tax rate at 1%.  The Social Security Act of 1935 set the original rate at 1% of the first $3,000 of annual income, with provisions to gradually ', u' that rate to 3% over the next twelve years:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThese figures have been adjusted many times over the years.  Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, as of 2005 participants pay 6.2% of the first $90,000 of their income (with their employers contributing a like sum) into what is commonly known as OASDI (from an acronym for Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance, the official name of the basic retirement benefits portion of the Social Security program).\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe original Social Security Act of 1935 specifically stated that  Social Security payroll taxes were ', u' to be allowed as income tax deductions:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nSocial Security payroll taxes have never been deductible from income for tax purposes, either when the program was originally instituted or at any time since.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe Social Security Trust Fund was established in 1939  to receive monies collected for Social Security through payroll taxes.  The monies in this fund are managed by the Department of the Treasury; they are not, nor have they ever been, put into the "general operating fund."  \r\n', u'\r\nHowever, whether the Social Security Trust Fund can truly be said to be "independent" is problematic.  The Social Security Act specifies that the monies in the fund may only "be invested in securities backed by the full faith and credit of the Federal government," such as treasury bills, treasury notes, and treasury bonds, as well as special issue bonds.  So, essentially, the government can "invest" Social Security funds by lending them to itself, then spending that money on programs not related to Social Security (e.g., defense, foreign aid, education).  The government "pays back" this money when the Social Security program redeems the bonds, but critics of the program contend Social Security will eventually fall into deficit by 2018, and the Treasury won\'t have the necessary cash on hand to redeem the bonds and pay back the fund.   As the Social Security and Medicare Trustees themselves noted in their 2005 ', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nA somewhat dated but detailed article about how the Social Security trust funds are invested can be found ', u'.\r\n\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIt is true that Social Security benefits were not originally considered taxable income.  However, that status was not due to any promise or act on the part of President Roosevelt, nor was it specified in the Social Security Act (or any other law); it was the result of a series of ', u' by the Treasury Department in 1938 and 1941 that excluded Social Security benefits from federal income taxation.   Those rulings were overriden by ', u' to the Social Security act enacted in 1983.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAs noted ', u', the monies paid into the Social Security trust have never been "put into the general fund." The requirements for how the Social Security Trust Fund is to be financed and invested have not changed since the fund\'s inception in 1939.  The reference to Lyndon Johnson indicates that someone was probably confused by a change implemented at the end of the Johnson administration (1969) that ', u' how the fund was accounted for in the federal budget but did not change the actual operations of the fund itself:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThis method of accounting for the Social Security Trust Fund in the federal budget was reversed in 1990.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAs noted ', u', Social Security withholding has never been deductible from income for tax purposes.  The original Social Security Act of 1935 specifically stated that monies paid into Social Security via payroll taxes were ', u' to be allowed as income tax deductions.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nPrior to 1984, income derived from Social Security benefits was exempt from taxation.  Amendments to the Social Security Act passed by Congress in 1983 allowed for 50% of Social Security benefits to be considered taxable income for taxpayers whose total income exceeded specified thresholds.\r\n', u'\r\nResponsibility for this change cannot fairly be assigned to either political party.  The idea originated with a proposal issued by the bipartisan ', u', which had been created by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.  The amendments were passed by a House of Representatives in which the Democrats held a clear majority of the seats ', u' but the proposed amendments received "Yea" votes from members of both parties, and they were signed into law by President Reagan.  \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Congress passed legislation that increased the percentage of Social Security benefits subject to taxation from 50% to 85%.  As with the 1983 amendments to the Social Security Act, this increase applied only to taxpayers whose total income exceeded specified thresholds.\r\n', u'\r\nThis change to Social Security was but one element of the massive Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (', u') introduced in Congress in 1993.  OBRA was barely passed by a ', u' ', u' in the House of Representatives, with not a single Republican voting in favor of it (although ', u' voted against it).  Likewise, the Senate ', u' on OBRA was deadlocked at ', u' (again, with not a single Republican voting in favor of it, although ', u' voted against it) until Vice-President Al Gore (a Democrat) cast the deciding "Yea" vote.   The bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton (also a Democrat).\r\n \r\n', u'\r\n\r\nNo one \u2014 whether he be a citizen, immigrant, or illegal ', u' eligible to collect Social Security ', u' unless he (or someone else, such as a parent or spouse) has paid into the system.  Someone has confused Social Security itself with Supplemental Security Income ', u' latter is a federal welfare program "designed to help aged, blind, and disabled people, who have little or no income" by providing "cash to meet basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter."  Immigrants can qualify for SSI benefits under certain conditions, but SSI is financed by general revenues and not Social Security taxes. SSI was not enacted by the administration of President Jimmy Carter (a Democrat); it was created and signed into law in 1972, during the administration of President Richard Nixon (a Republican).\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u' \xa0 24 February 2009\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

According to the rumor, the bonus in question would be disbursed in the form of "tax refunds" issued to immigrants who had paid no income taxes in the first place.

The oft-cited figure of $24,000 as an "amnesty bonus," for instance, applies only to a small pool of people who earned sufficient income to qualify for that credit during the three years in which they did not have Social Security numbers.  Second, the dollar amount mentioned is a theoretical maximum contingent upon the worker\'s qualifying for the highest possible Earned Income Tax Credit: specifically, having at least three children, and having earned income within the specified limits of eligibility requirements:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe number of immigrants who may meet the criteria for new citizenship policies and who could therefore qualify to amend or submit their tax returns isn\'t known, but the federal government is not doling out any sort of "bonus" based on immigration status. The policy change in question simply allows (among other things) immigrants who have now been granted Social Security numbers to amend or submit three years\' worth of previously filed tax returns to receive EITC credits based on previously-earned wages if they were so qualified.\r\n', u'\r\nNote that it is possible for any low-income taxpayer to have no tax liability (and thus pay no income tax) for a given year, yet still receive a "refund" by qualifying for the Earned Income Tax Credit.  That condition is a facet of the ', u" system that has nothing to do with one's immigration status.", u'\r\n\r\nOn ', u' 2015, the web site ', u' published an ', u' titled "IRS: Amnestied Illegals Don\'t Need to Have Filed Returns to Access Tax Credits for Illegal Work." That article linked to a set of five questions posed by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen following a February 2015 hearing about various aspects of that agency\'s operations. The second of those ', u' dealt with the subject of the EITC and deferred action:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nWhat Koskinen\'s clarification stated was that immigrants eligible under the amnesty program to claim EITC could do so by filing retroactive tax returns (i.e., submitting returns for years in which they had previously not filed at all) in addition to amending previous years\' returns.  But either way, claimants must still first file tax returns in order to be eligible for EITC, and they must show a documented history of earned income in order to qualify ("filers would have to reconstruct earnings and other records for years when they were not able to work on the books").  Thus,  although amnestied immigrants are eligible to retroactively amend and file tax documents in order to claim earned tax credits, they may do so only within the same framework that applies to all other taxpaying Americans (no further back than three years), and no exceptional flexibility in that regard has been extended to them due to amnesty provisions introduced in November 2014. \r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 5 June 2015\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

Since the standard ', u' for members of Congress at the time Jackson resigned his House seat was $174,000 per year, he could theoretically collect 60% of that amount ($104,400, or $8,700 per month) for up a year.  \r\n', u"\r\nIt's uncertain whether Jackson actually applied for, was approved for, and/or has collected any such disability retirement payments, though.  As the ", u" found, privacy laws preclude government officials from disclosing that information, and it's possible that reform measures passed by Congress in recent years might prevent him from receiving FERS disability retirement payments:\r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nThe question of how much money Jackson might someday garner from his Congressional pension (he isn't eligible to collect anything until 2021, when he turns 56) depends upon a number of factors.  In general, according to an August 2013 Congressional Research Service (CRS) ", u' on Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress, the accrual rate for pension benefits under FERS is 1.7% for the first 20 years and 1.0% for each year \r\nbeyond the 20th.

The IRS' initial solution was to create temporary numbers known as Internal Revenue Service Numbers (IRSN) to process the tax returns of such persons, but that system created a problem because IRSNs were assigned to tax returns rather than to the individuals filing those tax returns, a situation which made it difficult to track all the returns filed by any particular person.  To remedy that problem, in 1996 the IRS introduced the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (", u'), nine-digit numbers similar in structure to SSNs issued to individuals (regardless of their immigration status) who are required to have U.S. taxpayer identification numbers but are not eligible to obtain SSNs:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIn July 2012, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) issued a final ', u' titled "Substantial Changes Are Needed to the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number Program to Detect Fraudulent Applications" which stated the TIGTA had initiated an audit of the ITIN assignment process due to two congressional complaints alleging IRS management personnel were encouraging the approval of fraudulent ITIN applications, and that it found the complaints to be largely accurate:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIn its report, the TIGTA noted its analysis of ITIN application data had identified indications of possible fraud, such as ten addresses that were each issued thousands of tax refunds from returns using ITINs in 2011:\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nAs stated in the example quoted in the head of this article, four of those ten addresses were located in Atlanta, Georgia, with one address accounting for a total of nearly 24,000 different tax returns and over $46,000,000 in refunds.  However, whether such information is indicative of widespread tax fraud involving the use of ITINs by non-citizens cannot be determined from the information provided.  TIGTA\'s report did not claim to have uncovered specific cases of tax fraud; it offered charts such the one displayed as examples of how various analyses of IRS data could "identify indications of possible fraud."  It\'s possible some of the addresses referenced  above correspond to the offices of lawyers or accountants or some other service providers who assist immigrants and other non-citizens in preparing and filing tax returns. It\'s also possible that if some of those addresses are indeed connected to fraudulent tax return filings, the perpetrators of that activity are domestic criminals rather than "aliens."\r\n', u'\r\nThe July 2012 TIGTA report noted some of the deficiencies observed "had been brought to management\'s attention long ago" via a September 2002 report, but "management has failed to take sufficient action to address those deficiencies."

This is incorrect: the Medicare tax is not a sales tax, nor does it apply to all real estate transactions; it is a tax on ', u' (income which may or not derive from the sale of property) only for persons who earn more than the amounts specified in the bill.\r\n', u'\r\nFirst of all, the Medicare tax will be imposed ', u' on individuals with an income above $200,000 and couples with a joint income more than $250,000, a figure which currently excludes about 97% of all U.S. households.  Second, the tax will not be assessed on every house sale, but only on real estate transactions that produce profits over a specified dollar amount.  As Sara Orrange, Government affairs director of the Spokane Association of Realtors noted in ', u' to a repetition of the "sales tax" rumor in the Spokane ', u':\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nFor example, let's assume that a couple with an income of $325,000 bought a house in 2004 for $300,000 and resold it in 2013 for $850,000, thus producing a $550,000 profit.  Since U.S. law allows a couple to ", u" from their gross income\r\nprofits of up to $500,000 from the sale of their principal residence, the taxable gain from this sale would be $50,000 (i.e., a $550,000 profit minus the $500,000 exclusion), and the couple's taxable income would now be $375,000 (i.e., the original $325,000 plus the $50,000 of taxable profit from their home sale).   The 3.8% Medicare tax would now apply to whichever of the following dollar figures is the lesser:\r\n", u'\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nIn case (a), the dollar figure  would be the couple's taxable income ($375,000) minus the income threshold level ($250,000), or $125,000.\r\n", u'\r\nIn case (b), the dollar figure would be amount of taxable income gained from the sale of their home, which, as detailed above, was $50,000 (i.e., $550,000 profit minus the $500,000 exclusion).  \r\n', u'\r\nThe second dollar amount is the lesser of the two, and therefore the couple would have to pay an additional tax of ', u' of $50,000, which would amount to $1,900.  (If the hypothetical couple had realized less than a $500,000 profit on the sale of their residence, none of that gain would be subject to the 3.8% tax.)\r\n', u'\r\nThe referenced tax is therefore not a tax on all real estate sales; it is an investment income tax which ', u' result in a very small percentage of home sellers paying additional taxes on home sales profits over a designated threshold amount.   In short, if you\'re a "high earner" and you sell your home at a substantial profit, you might be required to pay an additional 3.8% tax. However, given that only about 3% of U.S. households have incomes that exceed the specified income threshold amount, the existing home sale capital gains exclusion on a principal residence ($250,000 for individuals, $500,000 for couples) still stands, and the national ', u' existing-home price in January 2012 was only $154,700 , the Medicare tax will likely affect only a very small percentage of home sellers when it is implemented in 2013.\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u' \xa0 15 March 2012\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

Because each state is allocated a number of electoral votes based on its population, and a successful candidate must win enough states to accumulate a majority of the electoral votes, a presidential aspirant cannot prevail simply by accumulating a large number of votes in one particular region of the country or by receiving a plurality of the popular vote in a crowded \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nfield.\r\n', u'\r\nFor example, even though segregationist governor George Wallace of Alabama received millions of votes in the ', u' presidential election, he had no chance of capturing an Electoral College majority because his appeal as a candidate was limited to the southern states.  Likewise, when the political divisions that preceded the Civil War produced a four-way race for the White House in ', u', Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois finished  last despite receiving as many popular votes as the second- and third-place candidates combined, because he was the first-choice candidate of only a single state (Missouri).\r\n', u'\r\nFaced with these odds, sometimes fringe parties and independent candidates undertake quixotic runs for the presidency anyway, for a variety of reasons ', u' make points about our political system, to try to establish themselves as viable entities in future elections, or to publicize a particular issue (or set of issues) which major-party candidates may not be discussing.  Other times, though, non-major parties choose not to run candidates of their own, but to instead align themselves with or support the candidate of the party that most closely meshes with their political platform (or has the best chance of defeating the candidate most antithetical to their platform).\r\n', u'\r\nThe latter point is applicable in this case.  The Communist Party USA (', u') has chosen not to field its own candidate in the 2004 presidential election.  Since the CPUSA would be classified as a party of the "far left," their platform is more likely to mesh with that of ', u' thus it is more likely to support the candidate of ', u' Democratic Party, the more leftward of the two major political parties.\r\n', u'\r\nEven at that, however, the CPUSA\'s response to inquiries about its preference in the upcoming presidential election makes it clear that it don\'t really "endorse" Senator John Kerry or any other major candidate ', u' platform is far more anti-Bush than it is pro-Kerry or pro-Democrat, and it "supports" Kerry in the sense of acknowledging that he is the candidate with the best chance of accomplishing the goal of defeating ', u' Bush:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAs political bedfellows go, this is far less a case of "He\'s the man for us!" than it is a case of "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."\r\n', u'\r\nThe coda about there hanging in a "Hanoi Hall of Fame" a picture of "John Kerry\'s shaking the hand of a communist official" as one of the "foreign activists who help defeat the United States Military in Vietnam" is a non-sequitur.

[Said Jody Rhome] \'We also told them they had to get their cars off the street because the street was being shut down.\'" \r\n', u'\r\nHowever, its next assertion, that "all residents on the street were REQUIRED to remove their Bush/Cheney signs," appears to contradict a line from an ', u' article two days after the event: "In an effort to block out the few dozen Bush supporters on one end of the street, Kerry officials provided volunteers with various Kerry signs in key positions to block Bush signage." Had neighbors been made to take \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ndown their Bush/Cheney signs, nothing would have remained that required screening from sight. Yet the ', u" statement might have referred to placards brandished by demonstrators rather than signs erected on people's lawns. However, a ", u' account of the day makes it clear that fixed signs were not removed, saying: "Beth Soucie, who stood in a yard filled with Bush signs, said she will stick with the Republican incumbent."

This is the ', u' account of some of those exchanges:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAccording to the ', u' "This mornings papers are reporting how hecklers tried to interrupt Kerry as he spoke to the neighborhood gathering, but he turned our chants to his favor by calling us rude."

Secret Service staffing levels vary as the situation requires, and lifetime protection for former Presidents and their spouses was eliminated by Congressional legislation in 1997.

Her sin was not one of entitlement (that is, she was not feeling she was a far more worthy person than those lesser beings whose duty it was to uncomplainingly forebear while she absconded with the first taxi) but of being sorely unaware of her surroundings.  Yet to an uninvolved onlooker who had seen her hoof straight to the first cab, it would have appeared she was deliberately placing herself ahead of others.\r\n', u'\r\nWhile inhabiting a similar state of unawareness, my husband\'s best friend once helped himself to the contents of a plastic-wrapped platter of cookies I had intended as a gift for someone else.

In this I see a potential echo to the "John Kerry ate my pizza" story ', u' Senator Kerry chow down on the pizza knowing it was meant for the pilots, or did he operate under the belief that it had been thoughtfully supplied as a snack for him, a visiting dignitary? Either, of course, would be a transgression worthy of sending Miss Manners into a fit of the vapors, but the underlying message about the character of the person involved would be different.

A similar list has now surfaced for 2008, this one a radical departure in that everything it lists (with a few minor exceptions) is actually accurate:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nExisting California law allowed a peace officer (or a salaried public employee engaged in directing traffic or enforcing parking laws and regulations) to remove or tow any vehicle "found or operated upon a highway, public lands, or an offstreet parking facility with a registration expiration date in excess of ', u' before the date it is found or operated."  The passage of ', u' in ', u' expanded the circumstances for such removals to include vehicles:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nExisting California law made it illegal "for a person to smoke a cigarette, cigar, or other tobacco-related product within ', u' of a playground or tot lot sandbox area."  The passage of ', u' in October 2007 expanded restrictions regarding smoking around children and made "an infraction punishable by a fine not exceeding $100 for a person to smoke a pipe, cigar, or cigarette in a motor vehicle, whether in motion or at rest, in which there is a minor."  The new law also carries the limitation that "a law enforcement officer shall not stop a vehicle for the sole purpose of determining whether the driver is in violation of this article." \r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nExisting California law prohibited "the use of a device that obstructs or impairs the reading or recognition of a license plate by a remote emission sensing device." The passage of ', u' in October 2007 expanded that restriction to include devices that obstruct the reading of license plates by devices "operated by state or local law enforcement or by an electronic device operated in connection with a toll road, high-occupancy toll lane, toll bridge, or other toll facility," and to criminalize the sale of such devices. \r\n', u'\r\nContrary to what is stated above, the fine established for persons convicted of the sale of license plate-obstructing devices is "$250 per item sold," not $900.\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThis item is a bit complicated, but the gist of it is that existing California law established a ', u' speed limit in school zones (i.e., on roadways within ', u' of schools), with a provision allowing local authorities to set lower limits if they conducted engineering and traffic surveys justifying the exceptions.  The passage of ', u' in October 2007 allows local jurisdictions to reduce speed limits from 25 to 15 miles per hour within ', u' of schools, and to require drivers to slow to ', u' per hour between 500 and ', u' from schools.  The new limits apply to schools on ', u' roads with maximum posted speeds of ', u' per hour. \r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe wording of this item is a bit misleading, as existing California law (as of ', u' 2007) already allowed "a peace officer to arrest and take into custody a person that a peace officer determines was engaged in a motor vehicle speed contest and permits the peace officer to cause the removal and seizure of the motor vehicle used in the contest."  The passage of ', u' in October 2007 extended those provisions to "persons engaged in reckless driving on a highway, reckless driving in an offstreet parking facility, or an exhibition of speed on a highway" and  requires the impounding agency to "release the vehicle to the registered owner prior to the conclusion of the impoundment period if the registered owner was neither the driver nor a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, or was unaware that the vehicle was being used to engage in the prohibited activities."\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nExisting California law already specified that the "operation of a bicycle upon a highway, during darkness, requires the use of an illuminated lamp and certain specified reflecting devices."  The passage of ', u' in September 2007 expanded "the places where the operator of a bicycle is required to use an illuminated lamp and certain specified reflecting devices" to include bikeways and "sidewalks where bicycle operation is not prohibited by the local jurisdiction."  It also modified the requirement that bicycle operators have reflectors on each pedal to include the option of  wearing reflectors on their shoes or ankles instead.\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nExisting California law already imposed safety specifications on electric personal assistive mobility devices (EPAMD) and their operation, but those provisions were set to be repealed on ', u' 2008 unless extended by statute.  The passage of ', u' in July 2007 extended those provisions indefinitely, requiring that the maximum speed of an EPAMD be no more than ', u' per hour and that an EPAMD to be no greater than ', u' deep and ', u' wide. The law also includes the following restrictions on the operators of EPAMDs:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe passage of ', u' in ', u' made it an infraction, as of ', u' 2008, to "drive a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone, unless that\r\ntelephone is designed and configured to allow hands-free listening and talking operation, and is used in that manner while driving," and it established a "base fine of $20 for a first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense."  As of that date, the ', u' will also prohibit minors from "driving a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone, ', u', and/or a mobile service device (pagers, texting devices, laptops, etc)."

When asked what he feels while taking a life, he answers not about any emotional response to killing another human being, but about his physical reality \u2014 that after squeezing off a shot he has to deal with the gun\'s recoil.  Within the framework of the tale, U.S. soldiers are depicted as many would like to think of them: cool-headed capable professionals who will ultimately overcome the enemy no matter what obstacles now stand in their way, because that is what they\'ve been trained to do and what they are very good at. The narrative thus delivers a measure of comfort, in that all feel reassured of their own safety, knowing they are defended by fighting men like these.\r\n', u'\r\nWhatever may be the truth about the emotional makeup of the average soldier, those who become snipers are very carefully chosen, not only for their marksmanship but for their emotional stability and outlook as well.

The Guantanamo Bay facility (abbreviated as GTMO,  hence its "Gitmo" nickname) has been decried as inhumane by a number of human rights associations and been denounced at various times in the American press. As we detail in our article about a ', u' on the situation at Gitmo, the detainees were initially incarcerated at ', u' a temporary holding facility near Guantanamo Bay. Inmates were kept in tin-roofed 8x8 cells that resembled dog runs: chain link fencing on a concrete base, open on the sides to the elements. They slept on foam pads placed on concrete floors in cells containing chemical toilets or buckets. At least every two days prisoners would be taken from their cells for all of ', u' of exercise. Those being held have since been moved to nearby Camp Delta, a permanent detention center erected for this purpose. The 8x6.66 cells have beds and walls and windows, flush toilets and running water, but can still be described as austere. \r\n', u"\r\nSome are outraged by the apparent human rights violations at Gitmo.

We don\'t know who came up with the idea for the ', u' protest \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n(it is often falsely attributed to newsman Bill Moyers) or what level of participation it might achieve; all we \r\ncan do is offer an opinion about its likelihood of success.  In this case our opinion is that someone has taken the futile concept of ', u' to a new extreme.\r\n', u'\r\nSome protests are functional; they involve people taking direct action to achieve the desired result, such as chaining oneself to a tree to prevent its being cut down.  Other protests are symbolic; they seek to inform the public or call attention to an issue through activities such as holding marches or making speeches.  Sometimes protests are a combination of the two: chaining oneself to a tree is a functional but necessarily short-term solution, yet such an event is usually covered by the media and thus helps to publicize the cause of conservation.\r\n', u'\r\nSo which form of protest is this supposed to be? Its ostensible purpose is a symbolic one \u2014 to "remind the people in power that the war in Iraq is immoral and illegal" \u2014  which leaves us wondering how this form of protest is supposed to help effect any change in circumstances The merits and conduct of the U.S. war with Iraq have been endlessly debated, in every medium, since the U.S. invasion of Iraq nearly two years ago.  The war in Iraq was the primary issue in a long, contentious, headline-dominating presidential campaign that ended just a few months ago.  The war is still one of the lead stories in the news nearly every day.  Many different polling organizations and major news outlets regularly survey public opinion on the issue.  If the result desired by those who would engage in this protest hasn\'t yet been achieved, it\'s not because the issue hasn\'t received enough publicity or those "in power" are insufficiently aware of it.\r\n', u"\r\nAll that aside, the suggested scheme is one of the least effective forms of symbolic protest one could devise: it literally proposes that people do nothing, and doing nothing generates little, if any, publicity or news coverage.  Massing thousands of people in one place and engaging speakers to make rousing public speeches provide vivid, well-defined images for the news media to pick up on, but pictures of people not spending money just don't make compelling fodder for newspapers and television.  (Images of normally bustling malls, restaurants, and airports standing eerily devoid of human traffic might make for a good news story, but public opinion on this issue is far too divided for this protest to be able to bring ", u" business to a grinding halt.)  Even worse, when you call upon people to do nothing, how is anyone supposed to gauge the success of your efforts?  There's no way to distinguish those who are doing nothing out of principle from those who are simply doing nothing out of \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nhabit.\r\n', u"\r\nAs a functional protest, this one is equally off the mark.  Although a boycott can be an active form of protest (even though boycott participants are in effect doing nothing, they're following a course of action that directly affects the object of their protest), boycotts succeed by causing economic harm to their targets, thereby putting them out of business or at least requiring them to change their policies in order to remain in business.  But the target of this boycott isn't an entity that has the power to bring about the desired resolution (i.e., the government) \u2014 those who will be economically harmed by it are innocent business operators and their employees.  These people have no power to set ", u" policy or recall troops from Iraq, but they're the ones who would have to pay the price for this form of protest, incurring all their usual overhead costs (e.g., lighting, heat, refrigeration) to keep their businesses open and paying employees' salaries, all the while taking in little or no income.  (And no, it doesn't all even out in the end \u2014 restaurants, for example, aren't going to recoup their lost business through boycott participants' eating twice as much the next day.) \r\n", u'\r\nWhether the desired goal is laudable or not, a protest that has little chance of succeeding at its purpose but a high likelihood of harming innocent parties does no one any good.  As we always say about these kinds of things, results are generally proportional to effort: If the most effort one is willing to put into a cause is to do nothing, then one should expect to accomplish nothing in return.\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 14 January 2005\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\xa0\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n'] @@@

However, the difference between "citizen" and "natural-born citizen" is an important one in this case, and some of the legal distinctions between the two are still murky.  (The particular sticking points in Senator McCain\'s case are whether the Panama Canal Zone was covered by existing citizenship laws at the time of his birth, and whether someone who was born outside the U.S. and holds ', u' status by virtue of a law passed after his birth and applied retroactively qualifies as a natural-born citizen.)\r\n', u'\r\nThe framers of the Constitution didn\'t elaborate on the term "natural born citizen," there has never been a court case defining exactly what a "natural-born citizen" is, and neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has definitively resolved the issue.

In an attempt to balance the competing interests of those who wanted the U.S. to maintain a much larger standing army and those who felt an expanded peacetime army was both too expensive and contrary to American tradition, Congress passed the Militia Act of 1903 (also known as the Dick Militia Act or the Dick Act, named for Ohio Congressman Charles Dick), which established the National Guard as the Army's primary organized reserve. \r\n", u'\r\nAccording to ', u', a history of the Army National Guard:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nMost everything stated about the Dick Act in the example quoted above is erroneous, however:\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nUnder current public law, the militia of the United States comprises ', u' not three: the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and the unorganized militia, which consists of those who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.

The existence and enforcement of modern laws limiting the ownership of certain types of firearms is ', u' evidence that those laws have not been "invalidated" by a piece of legislation enacted back in 1903.  (And even if such a claim were true, then the unfettered right to keep and bear arms would not apply to men over the age of 45 or to any women, as neither of those groups falls within the legal definition of "unorganized militia.")\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nNo legislation is immune from being repealed, and in fact much of the content of the Dick Act has effectively been repealed through the passage of subsequent modifying legislation such as the Militia Act of 1908, the National Defense Act of 1916, and the National Defense Act of 1920. \r\n', u'\r\nMoreover, "bills of attainder" and ', u' facto laws" are legal terms that have nothing to do with a supposed prohibition on the repeal of legislation: the former is a legislative act pronouncing a person guilty of a crime without trial, and the latter refers to laws that retroactively impose punishments for actions that were legal prior to the passage of those laws.\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nAlthough it was true at one time, it is not now the case that "the President of the United States has zero authority without violating the Constitution to call the National Guard to serve outside of their state borders." \r\n', u'\r\nThe Dick Act authorized the federal callup of National Guard units for nine months (with the restriction that they serve within U.S. borders), and a 1908 amendment to the Dick Act eliminated both the nine-month callup limit and the restriction on National Guard units serving outside the United States.

Such debates typically feature each side presenting charts contrasting violent crime and homicide rates in countries with permissive and restrictive gun ownership laws to make the case that the prevalence of guns corresponds to either higher or lower crime rates.\r\n', u'\r\nThe wake of the Umpqua Community College shooting brought the widespread online circulation of the image shown above, which sought to make the point that two countries of roughly equal population, Honduras and Switzerland, had radically different laws regarding gun ownership and radically different homicide rates: Switzerland, where gun \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nownership is supposedly mandatory, has the world's lowest homicide rate, while Honduras, where gun ownership is supposedly prohibited, has the world's highest homicide rate.\r\n", u"\r\nFirst off, even before we check the specific claims about each country, we have to note that this item presents a flawed premise.  For a comparison of this nature to be valid, the two things being compared should be fairly equivalent outside of the factors being examined, but that isn't the case here.  The two countries mentioned here are so very different that this isn't just a comparison of apples and oranges; it's more like a comparison of apples and radishes.\r\n", u'\r\nHonduras and Switzerland are roughly equivalent in ', u' (a little of upwards of ', u" people each), but other than that, they aren't the least bit similar in geography, economics, or culture.  Switzerland is a small, landlocked country in western Europe surrounded by three of the most affluent countries in the world (Germany, France, and Italy) in terms of gross domestic product (", u'), and even though Switzerland itself is fairly small in population (96th in the world) and size (134th in the world), it ranks in the top 20 in terms of GDP.  On the other hand, Honduras is a Central American country that is nearly three times the ', u' of Switzerland and possesses coasts along both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean sea, \r\nbut is a "lower middle-income country with persistent ', u' and inequality challenges,"\r\nwith a GDP only about 2.5% that of Switzerland and three neighbors (Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala) that share similar economic conditions.  Not to mention that Honduras is right in the path of the flow of drugs shipped by sea and air from Colombia and has therefore been ravaged by the ', u' and its attendant factors of massive criminal organizations, violence, and governmental instability.\r\n', u'\r\nAs far as homicide rates go, Honduras does have the ', u" intentional homicide rate in the world at about 90.4 homicides per 100,000 people per year (which is even shockingly higher than the homicide rate of the next worst country, Venezuela, at 53.7).  Although Switzerland's intentional homicide rate is indeed low at 0.6, it isn't quite the lowest in the world: it's bested by several other countries such as \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nLiechtenstein, Monaco, Iceland, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, the ', u' ', u' of which have some of the most restrictive gun control laws in the world.  Moreover, a better metric for comparison purposes here might perhaps be the ', u" death rate rather than the overall intentional homicide rate; in that case, Honduras is still the worst, but Switzerland doesn't fare quite as well (ranking behind about 43 other countries).\r\n", u'\r\nAdditionally, it is not true that Honduras "bans citizens from owning guns" nor that Switzerland "requires citizens to own guns."  Honduras enacted a ban on open and concealed carry in 2007, but a 2012 ', u' stated that "under the existing law, citizens are allowed to own as many as five personal firearms," and in mid-2014 ', u' ', u' Honduras as one of the "10 Best Countries for Gun Owners," saying that "Hondurans may purchase most popular types of shotguns, handguns or rifles for the recognized purposes of self-defense and recreation."  While Switzerland ranks fourth among all countries in ', u' per capita (much higher than Honduras), they do not "require" all their citizens to own guns.  Switzerland has a long history of ', u' military service for all able-bodied male citizens.  The government issues ', u' to conscripted men which, after training, they take home with them and keep until the conclusion of their military obligation (about age 34 for non-officers), but no other citizens are "required" to own guns:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nSwiss citizens ', u' buy and keep firearms, subject to certain ', u' and licensing requirements:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nAll in all, this meme compares two countries that aren't the least bit similar, then gets wrong nearly all the aspects of those countries it references.

And when the list of victims' names was subsequently released to the public, no children named Brian or Ellie appeared on it. (The first note is curiously written in both Hungarian and English and reads more like a child's note to his deceased mother.)\r\n", u' \xa0\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nMany readers have inquired about the correct address for sending sympathy cards to personnel at Sandy Hook Elementary:\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u"\r\nThis is the correct physical address for Sandy Hook Elementary School (Sandy Hook itself is a village within the town of Newtown), although we can't say how receptive the personnel there will be to receiving a flood of sympathy cards or whether they have the space and staff necessary to store and process them all.

Roberts then walked down a hall, down some steps and shot himself to death.\r\n", u'\r\nAccording to an interview he gave with Portland television station KGW, a citizen named Nick Meli was present in the mall that day, carrying a concealed weapon for which he had a permit.  When Meli heard Roberts open fire, he pulled his own weapon and trained it on Roberts but did not shoot for fear of hitting a bystander:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nWhether Meli's self-reported actions prevented additional loss of life that day is a matter of speculation \u2014 since Jacob Roberts killed himself at the scene, there's no way of knowing for sure whether his being confronted by an armed citizen might have caused him to break off shooting earlier than he otherwise would have.\r\n", u'\r\n', u'\r\nA similar item of inquiry concerned a 1997 school shooting in Mississippi:\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIn this 1 October 1997 incident, 16-year-old Luke Woodham stabbed his mother to death with a butcher knife in their home, then drove to his high school in Pearl, Mississippi, with a ', u' where he killed two classmates and wounded seven more.  Woodham was apprehended in his car by assistant principal Joel Myrick, who confronted him with a ', u' pistol he had retrieved from own vehicle.\r\n', u'\r\nJoel Myrick didn\'t actually "halt" the shooting at Pearl High, as Luke Woodham had broken off his attack, exited the school, headed toward the parking lot, and was attempting to leave the school in his car when he was finally stopped by Myrick.  The claim that Myrick\'s actions saved additional lives stems from reports that Woodham was on his way to Pearl Junior High School to continue shooting when Myrick subdued him, but evidence documenting that Woodham had such an intent is not conclusive.\r\n', u' \xa0\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nAnother item had to do with rumors that members of the Westboro Baptist Church were planning on picketing the funerals of Newtown shooting victims:\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u' (WBC) is an Independent Baptist church in Topeka, Kansas, headed by pastor Fred Phelps.  WBC is widely known for its anti-homosexual stance, and members of its congregation have drawn much publicity by staging ', u" protests and picketing at the funerals of military members and celebrities. (At such funerals, WBC members typically portray the deceased's passing as God's punishment for America's tolerance of homosexuality.)\r\n", u'\r\nShortly after the Newtown shootings, concern arose that WBC was planning to picket the funerals of the victims of that tragedy due to a ', u' post issued on the morning after the shootings by Shirley Phelps-Roper, a spokesperson for the group, which said that "Westboro will picket Sandy Hook Elementary School to sing praise to God for the glory of his work in executing his judgment."  It was unclear exactly what and when WBC was planning to picket, although another ', u' from Margie Phelps suggested that the target of the picketing would be a ', u' 2012 ', u' attended\r\nby President Obama.  (That event came off with no Westboro protesters in sight.)  \r\n', u' \xa0\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nAnother item of interest was a widely-circulated blog post titled "I Am Adam Lanza\'s Mother":\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nOn the day of the Newtown shootings, Liza Long posted an entry entitled "', u'" on her ', u' blog, about her difficulties in dealing with her own mentally ill ', u' old son due to our society\'s "stigma on mental illness and its broken healthcare system" which provides no option other than treating the mentally ill as criminals.

Some, such as Limbaugh biographer Paul Colford, imply that Limbaugh's knee injury was minor or non-existent:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nHowever, that Limbaugh did indeed have a ', u' seems indisputable, as he himself, his mother, and his brother all maintain that he did:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAnd a pilonidal cyst was indeed a legitimately disqualifying condition:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n(Limbaugh critics have maintained that his pilonidal cyst was a "simple-to-treat condition" easily corrected through minor surgery, and that it was not a legitimately debilitating condition that precluded his serving in the armed forces but simply an excuse he seized upon to avoid military service.)\r\n', u"\r\nThat the disqualifying condition was a pilonidal cyst and not a bad knee seems to be borne out by Limbaugh's own comments on his draft status:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nIt\'s highly unlikely that Limbaugh only "discovered" he had a high school football knee injury several years after the fact or was unaware that a bad knee was reason for a physical deferment, so the pilonidal cyst is the far more probable explanation.\r\n', u"\r\n(The lottery issue is largely irrelevant since Limbaugh's ", u" classification precluded his being drafted no matter how high or low his birthdate came up in the lottery.  In the event, Limbaugh's birth date was selected 152nd in the ", u" draft lottery, and since the highest lottery number ultimately called for this group was 125, he wouldn't have been drafted in 1971 no matter what his classification.)\r\n", u'\r\nWhen asked about this issue nowadays, Limbaugh dismisses it as "Internet BS," as in this excerpt from a ', u' of a ', u' ', u' to his radio program:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThese kinds of responses, provided by Limbaugh on his show and available on the ', u' web site, are unconvincing and dissembling.  Why not just give a straightforward answer to the question? After all, "I had a knee injury" is a simple explanation (and hardly an embarrassing one), but dismissing the issue as "Internet BS" and railing against "Internet conspiracy theories" sound too much like the response of someone who is evading the question.  Instead, Limbaugh provides non-responsive "answers" when queries are posed by quickly steering the focus away from himself and claiming that "the message is that unless you\'ve been a member of the military, you have no right to support it" (which isn\'t the message at all: the message is about whether it\'s hypocritical for those who escaped the draft to criticize others who did) but doesn\'t address the issue of his own draft status in the least. \r\n', u'\r\nThere is, of course, a huge difference between draft evasion (or "draft dodging") and draft avoidance: The former involves the use of unethical or illegal means (e.g., bribing a doctor to falsify a medical report, fleeing the country) to escape military service; the latter involves taking advantage of established legal means (e.g., college deferments, conscientious objector status) to avoid or delay military service.   The issue discussed here is clearly not one of draft evasion, and the matter of who is justified in criticizing whom for not serving in Vietnam is a gray area to be hashed out in the public arena. The only conclusions drawn here are that Rush Limbaugh was ineligible for the draft due to a physical condition, that he had a pilonidal cyst, and that if there\'s an explanation for his draft status other than the cyst, he has yet to offer it.\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 17 June 2014\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

Images of the incident were broadcast on several news networks. The videotape shows a squad of Marines entering the building and seeing several Iraqis lying against a wall, either dead or gravely wounded. One Marine shouts something about one Iraqi feigning death. The Marine then shoots the man in the head. \r\n', u' \r\nThe wounded men were insurgents who had fought a different group of Marines the day before. In that firefight, ten Iraqi fighters were killed and five were wounded.

A different squad of Marines that had not been involved in the previous day's encounter was sent to investigate. That group entered the mosque and saw the men lying on the floor. It was then that one of their number killed one of the wounded.\r\n", u'\r\nAccording to ', u', such non-combat killings of Iraqis by American soldiers have taken place before:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nIn December 2004, Staff Sergeant Johnny Horne was found guilty of the murder of a severely wounded Iraqi civilian in Baghdad's Sadr City district on ", u' and given a sentence of three years.

Did a Marine genuinely convinced he and members of his unit were in immediate and grave danger put to death a wounded man who afterwards was shown to have posed no threat to their safety? Or did a young man stressed too far by the conflict of war and by the memory of wounds received in it temporarily give over control of himself to his emotions, momentarily acting on the anger and rage that fuels battlefield encounters?

Only the U.S. military can decide what charges, if any, will be laid, with that determined by the findings of its investigation, not by how much or how little support the accused's act has among the general public. If charges are laid, the trial will take place before a military tribunal and any sentence handed down in that court-martial served in a military prison.

(The requirement for young men to register with the Selective Service was not abolished until 1975, however, and it was reinstated in \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n1980.)\r\n', u'\r\nAs recent U.S. military involvement in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq has required the largest commitment of American troops since the mid-1970s, and the military has had to double the deployment periods of some units, call up additional reserves, and extend tours of duty by a year in order to maintain adequate staffing levels, the specter of a resurrected draft has been looming on the mind of many a young person.  Although the possibility of a reinstatement of conscription cannot be ruled out, a renewal of the draft anytime soon appears unlikely, and one implemented as early as June 2005 seems rather improbable.\r\n', u'\r\nAs reflected in the message quoted above, the draft issue has largely come to public attention due to pair of bills introduced in Congress (', u' and ', u") which seek to obligate all citizens and residents of the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 26 (both male and female) to perform a two-year period of national service (not necessarily as part of the military), and the Selective Service's ", u' for volunteers to man ', u' around the country.  However, both these bills were introduced not by legislators genuinely seeking to reinstate the draft but by Democrats seeking to make an anti-war statement, and they languished in committee for ', u' before Republicans brought the House version to the floor and overwhelmingly defeated it in October 2004.  \r\n', u'\r\nThe Selective Service also maintained that the timing of ads to fill draft board positions was coincidental, part of a process of filling expired board positions that had been underway for several years:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nOpinions \u2014 from both those inside and outside the military \u2014 differ as to what the manpower requirements of the U.S. armed forces will be in the near future, and whether the services will be able to continue to meet those requirements under the current all-volunteer system.  And certainly not everyone agrees that general conscription is the best solution to potential staffing shortfalls, for a variety of reasons:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nSince a reimposition of conscription would require Congressional approval, which has not yet been given, it is unlikely that a draft (even if approved by Congress) would be underway as early as ', u':\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nEven if the draft started up again, it might be of a much more limited nature than in previous years, with only those who could fill specialized positions in certain fields (e.g., health care, linguistics, computer technology) being conscripted. \r\n', u'\r\nThere is no definitive answer to the question of whether or not the U.S. will reinstitute a draft.  Obviously some thought has been given to the issue, but the possibility that such thoughts will be turned into reality appears rather small at this point, and President Bush has stated that there will be no resumption of the draft during his presidency.

Although his choosing a two-year enlistment (the same as if he'd been drafted) rather than a three-year enlistment meant that he technically did not get to choose his occupational speciality, realistically there was little chance he would be assigned to a combat position.

Gore biographer Bob Zelnick maintained that this claim was baseless, as a ', u' 1970 article in the ', u' reported that Gore had already "received orders to go to Vietnam."  Whatever the case, Gore did not arrive in Vietnam until the very end of 1970, by which time only seven months remained of his enlistment term.

Obviously, this was a non-combat position, and some of those who served with Gore reported that their superiors requested Gore "should cover only military operations where security was good."  However, they also reported that Gore had not asked for any such arrangement, nor was he aware of it.

Army regulations at the time allowed for early discharge of personnel who wanted to teach or attend school if their services were considered "not essential to the mission."

After spending a final month at the ', u' Engineer Command in Long Binh, Gore was mustered out and sent home two months early to attend Vanderbilt Divinity School.

The idea was not an entirely new one, as rumors of "chicken pox parties" circulated for years before the introduction of a chicken pox vaccine. In both scenarios, parents purportedly aimed to deliberately infect children with once-common childhood diseases in an effort to ensure resultant immunity was achieved within a convenient age range. (In the years before a vaccines was available for chicken pox, parents often hoped the near inevitable virus would sweep through the home while children were young enough to recover quickly and without infecting infants.)\r\n', u'\r\nIn a 2015 measles outbreak traced to Disneyland, more than ', u' contracted that illness across at least ', u' and reignited a long-running debate over the value of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccinations.

Although that seemed plausible to many readers, a few initial inconsistencies were present.\r\n', u'\r\nWhile measles and chicken pox were both at one time common childhood illnesses, a vaccine for the latter virus is a fairly recent development. As such, measles was rarer in recent decades than chicken pox, and measles eradication was declared in the U.S. in 2000. Only ', u' to date have contracted ', u' in California in the 2015 outbreak, hardly a number sufficient for measles parties to be a real trend of any description. By contrast, entire communities of children contracted chicken pox in recent memory, and infected youngsters were not uncommon in the not-too-distant past.\r\n', u'\r\nFurthermore, all iterations of the claim lacked any substantive evidence of the existence of measles parties outside anyone\'s imaginations.

The claims it contained subsequently circulated across alternative health blogs, and were unique in part because no other outlet reported anything remotely resembling them prior to the article.', u'\r\n\r\nThe background of the piece entailed a controversy that began in August 2014, when Centers for Disease Control researcher Dr. William Thompson was identified by vaccine opponents in a series of claims regarding 2004 study.

Secondly, Thompson denied he\'d been sanctioned to any degree within the CDC:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIn the August 2014 statement, Thompson also said:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nNearly six months later, the February 2015 article linked above was published, claiming Thompson was granted immunity by the Obama administration.

In some iterations the statement was amended to specify "child deaths," but the article itself stated there were zero deaths (among all age groups) from measles in the United States in the timeframe cited. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat claim is inaccurate, as the CDC has ', u' that a Washington woman who passed away in early 2015 died from (an initially undetected) measles infection:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAccording to the World Health Organization, 145,000 people around the world ', u' of measles in 2013 alone, and documents on the CDC web site also record two U.S. ', u' from the measles in 2009, and another two ', u' from measles in 2010. \r\n', u'\r\n(Other sources, including the CDC, sometimes confusingly cite 2003 as the year of the last previous recorded measles death in the U.S.  According to the CDC, that difference is due to the 2003 death being listed as "confirmed," while the other cases have statuses of "reported" or "suspected" but not "confirmed.")\r\n', u'\r\nThe ', u' article also failed to address the reason ', u' measles killed so few Americans in the period cited. The glaring omission had a very specific root cause, namely measles ', u':\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIt stands to (very simple) reason a timespan beginning in 2004 (four years after measles elimination) and ending just before the late 2014 outbreak would see few (albeit not zero) deaths from measles, because the viral infection had been largely eliminated from the United States during the period specifically selected to illustrate the purported innocuous nature of measles.', u'\r\n\r\nThe second portion of the claim entailed deaths attributed directly to the MMR vaccine in the same period. Even if a minute number of fatalities were proved to have resulted from the MMR vaccine, it would still be impossible to accurately contrast that figure with deaths due to a disease no longer spreading in the United States during the period selected. That speculation itself, however, is a big "if." According to the article, their figures for MMR deaths were culled from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), but VAERS does not exist to track specific and proved adverse reactions to vaccines. The purpose of the system is clearly ', u' on the VAERS site (in a disclaimer not reproduced by the article spreading the claim):\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nSubmission to VAERS alone is not evidence of vaccine-related injury or illness. The overwhelming majority of young children residing in the United States receive the MMR vaccine early in their lives, and a small number of those children have become ill (some fatally) due to reasons found to be unrelated to the vaccine. There is nothing to preclude individuals from submitting VAERS reports of sickness or death that are wholly unrelated to vaccines, and the system exists not to track substantiated incidents of vaccine injury but to identify potential trends in vaccine administration.\r\n', u'\r\nFew people died of measles in the U.S. between 2004 and 2015 because measles was classified as eliminated in 2000. Relatively few people in the U.S. contracted the viral infection after that, so it stands to reason far fewer would go on to die of it. And while more than ', u' of suspected adverse reaction or death may have been reported to VAERS in the years cited, that number references unconfirmed public reports, not verified vaccine-related fatalities. \r\n', u'\r\nFinally, the possibility of death is not the only reason one should (or should want to) vaccinate a child against measles.

Beginning in 2014, U.S. citizens and legal residents are required to either have PPACA-qualifying health insurance coverage (public or private) or pay a penalty for not carrying insurance. \r\n', u'\r\nShortly after the opening of PPACA-created state- and federal-run insurance exchange marketplaces on ', u' 2013, which consumers could use to shop online for qualifying \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ninsurance plans, the item reproduced above began circulating on the Internet.  This item claimed that after a consumer priced an insurance plan on one of the exchanges and found it to be unsuitably ', u" (and so declined to enroll in it), he received a notice stating that he would be fined over $4,000 and have his driver's license suspended, and if he failed to pay the fine within two years the a federal tax lien would be placed on his home.\r\n", u"\r\nWithout knowing more details about the person referenced in this item, it's difficult to accurately assess whether the figures quoted for insurance coverage ($597.00 per month with a $13,988 yearly deductible) are completely accurate.   However, the PPACA sets annual limits on out-of-pocket expenses at $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families on plans offered through the state-based exchanges, so a yearly deductible of nearly $14,000 for someone shopping for coverage through an insurance exchange isn't a plausible offering.\r\n", u'\r\nThe penalty for failing to carry qualifying health insurance coverage varies with household size, income, and year.  In general, the penalties for non-compliance will be assessed as follows:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nThe $4,037 fine claimed in this item doesn't jibe with those figures.  Since the non-compliance penalty for an individual in 2014 is $95 or 1% of income above the tax filing threshold (whichever is greater), that individual would have to earn a yearly income of $403,700 (above the tax filing threshold) in order to incur a fine of that magnitude for a single ", u' income level which is far larger than the ', u' range claimed in this item.   Even adding together all the potential fines for three straight years of non-compliance beginning in 2014 produces a figure in the $3,000 range, not one over $4,000.  (The figures could be higher under a scenario in which multiple persons in the same household were non-compliant, but the item quoted above references only an individual.)\r\n', u'\r\nAccording to a Congressional Research Service (CRS) ', u" on the PPACA Penalty Provision and the Internal Revenue Service, collection of the penalty for failure to maintain qualifying health insurance coverage may include the IRS' withholding money from federal income tax refunds and obtaining liens against the taxpayer's property, but the PPACA does not allow for criminal prosecution or the seizure of bank accounts or other property:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\n(Note that a "lien" and a "levy" are two different things.  A lien is a claim against property that does not involve the right to seize property, while a levy is a seizure of property. A lien does not allow the lienholder to sell another\'s property, but when property subject to the lien is sold, the lien establishes the right to receive proceeds from the sale of the property before they are distributed to the seller.) \r\n', u"\r\nIn short, failure to pay the PPACA non-compliance penalty might result in the IRS' sending you warning letters and deducting the penalty amount from your future tax refunds  (if you have any), but not throwing you in jail, forcibly taking money from your bank account, or seizing your house or other property.  We have also found no provision of the PPACA or IRS code that would allow the federal government to suspend an individual's driver's license as a penalty for non-compliance with the individual mandate provision of the PPACA.\r\n", u'\r\n', u' \xa0 4 October 2013\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

One rumor which has grown out of this aspect of the PPACA is the claim that some religious groups, particularly Muslims (but also including Scientologists, Amish, and Christian Scientists), are specifically exempted from health insurance requirements of the PPACA.\r\n', u'\r\nThe fact is that the PPACA legislation does not specifically exclude any particular religious groups from its provisions.  The bill contains a general "religious conscience" section which sets forth guidelines under which religious groups who have established conscientious objections to certain forms of insurance may seek exemption from its health insurance requirements: \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nFor members of religious groups to qualify for this exemption, they would have to be adherents of a religion or sect "described in section 1402(g)(1)" of the ', u', which governs exemptions from the payment of Social Security and Medicare taxes on self-employment income.  In general, persons seeking a health insurance exemption must belong to a religion (or sect thereof) which has been in existence since 1951 and has an established history of spurning participation in insurance programs:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nHow these provisions might be applied is currently a matter of speculation, not fact.  Groups such as the Anabaptists  (i.e., Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites) would likely qualify for an exemption from the health insurance requirement, as they have an established history of declining Social Security benefits and making their own provisions for dependent members (as described in the ', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nWhether Muslims would qualify for an exemption from the health insurance requirements is more difficult to define, as Islam is a much larger religion with practices that vary according to sect and region.  Although Islam does have a tradition of ', u' conventional insurance products because they "involve an element of uncertainty, gambling and the charging of interest, which are \r\n\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nprohibited by the Koran," some Muslim groups make exceptions for insurance which is required by law (such as automobile insurance), and some Muslim groups do not have objections to medical insurance.  Most likely, though, Muslims would not qualify for an exemption from U.S. health insurance requirements because ', u' do not have a tradition of spurning Social Security (which is viewed more as a form of caring for those who are unable to meet their own needs than as something which involves elements of uncertainty, gambling, and interest payments), and no Muslim group has ever qualified for an exemption under the guidelines which define which religious groups would be exempt from the health care law.\r\n', u'\r\nThe PPACA does not specifically "deny special exemptions to Christians and Jews," but it is unlikely that either of those groups would qualify for a blanket religious conscience exemption, as neither of those groups has a history of disdaining or prohibiting the use of insurance among their membership.\r\n', u'\r\nThe bottom line is that the health insurance ', u" provision of PPACA doesn't kick in until the year 2014, and between then and now there's no telling what challenges may be launched (or accepted) regarding who might be exempt from it.\r\n", u'\r\nDespite frequent mention of the term in Internet-circulated rumors, the word "Dhimmitude" does not appear in the PPACA, and it has no application to U.S. health care legislation.

Back in 2003, two versions of a bill that proposed the regulation of dietary supplements (', u', the "Dietary Supplement Safety Act of 2003," and ', u', the "Dietary Supplement Access and Awareness Act") were introduced to Congress.  Neither of these bills was ever voted upon, much less passed.  They both expired with the end of the ', u' in 2004 and have not been reintroduced to the currently sitting ', u'\r\n', u"\r\nMoreover, neither of these items of potential legislation was forced on the U.S. by an outside regulatory body, nor did they say anything about restricting the American public's access to vitamins and minerals. Their sole target was dietary supplements, a class of products that has been unregulated since 1994, when Congress passed legislation that exempted them from federal regulation. Claims that your right to take vitamins and minerals is about to be impaired or that you will require doctors' prescriptions to obtain such products should be regarded as attempts at rabble-rousing, deliberate moves to spur you into action against one thing by convincing you that something very different and far closer to your heart is at stake.\r\n", u'\r\nVitamins and minerals are not under the gun. Dietary supplements are. And no outside regulatory body is behind this move: the proposed legislation is the work of American lawmakers looking to safeguard the public from the unscrupulous and the hazardous. ', u'\r\n', u'\r\nDespite their presence on store shelves, not all dietary supplements are safe for consumers to use, let alone are beneficial to their health. Products can be 100% natural yet deliver a deadly payload, as have some in the past. Lacking regulation of such ingestibles, there is no protection afforded consumers, and \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nauthoritative-looking labels are no guarantee that what is being vended in those bottles they envelop is not harmful. Under current law, dangerous supplements get onto the market and stay there, with serious physical harm resulting among those who use them, as was the case with ephedra, which caused strokes, heart attacks, and upwards of ', u' before the Food and Drug Administration was finally able to get it out of the stores.\r\n', u'\r\nIn 2004, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, almost one in five Americans (19%) reported using a supplement, which means the pool of folks at risk is great. Yet the incentives are there for the dietary supplement industry to keep on doing what it has been doing: in 2002, it reported ', u' in sales. With so much profit at stake, there is little desire on the part of manufacturers to police themselves or their products all that carefully. \r\n', u'\r\nIt\'s not just about inherently dangerous substances being sold to the unwary as the latest miracle answer for what ails them \u2014 even when dietary supplements contain nothing obviously harmful, the current lack of regulation results in improperly manufactured or contaminated products reaching the public. Quality control is missing. Absent regulation, consumers have little reason to trust they are getting the dosage they believe they are taking. ConsumerLab.com, an independent laboratory that tests dietary supplements, found that some name-brand products contain only small quantities of the active ingredient on their label. "Some have none, some have ', u' some have ', u' ', u' Cooperman, president of the lab, told ', u' Also, some contaminated supplements reach the market and thus fall into the hands of unknowing consumers. In December 2004, pesticide was found in ginseng being vended on the East Coast, and heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic were discovered in herbal supplements.\r\n', u'\r\nTwo bills put before Congress in 2003 looked to regulate dietary nostrums by imposing quality and safety standards on them, and giving the FDA the ability to take them off the market before a great number of folks have been harmed by them. In March 2003, Senator Richard Durbin introduced bill ', u', the "Dietary Supplement Safety Act of 2003" in the U.S. Senate. The purpose of this legislation was to "protect consumers from dangerous dietary supplements such as ephedra and other stimulants by requiring manufacturers to submit proof that their product is safe prior to bringing it to market." The bill would require manufacturers of the most dangerous types of dietary supplements (stimulants) to submit proof of their products\' safety prior to bringing them to market. The bill also expands the FDA\'s authority to require from any dietary supplement maker proof of its product\'s safety if that agency has received information suggesting the product is causing death or other serious adverse health effects. It would also require manufacturers to report serious adverse health events (e.g.; heart attack, seizure, stroke, death), to the FDA no later than ', u' days after they learn of them. The bill also looks to close a loophole in current law that, according to Senator Durbin, "has been exploited by many dietary supplement manufacturers, allowing anabolic steroids to be sold widely as dietary supplements" by clarifying that anabolic steroids are not dietary supplements and are subject to regulation that restricts their availability under the Controlled Substances Act.\r\n', u'\r\nIn October 2003, Representatives Susan Davis ', u' Henry Waxman ', u' and John Dingell (DMI) introduced bill ', u', the "Dietary Supplement Access and Awareness Act" in the U.S. House of Representatives. This legislation would increase the FDA\'s authority over dietary supplements, enabling that agency to monitor the health risks of dietary supplements and take appropriate action if problems develop. The proposed law was not intended to have any impact on the regulation of vitamins and minerals, which are specifically excluded from the bill. In addition, for dietary supplements that contain herbs, amino acids, and other botanicals, the bill will ensure that FDA has basic information about who makes them and the products\' ingredients. It would also require dietary supplement manufacturers to provide FDA with information about all adverse events, so that the agency could spot warning signs and investigate if necessary. It further allows the FDA to prohibit sales to minors of supplements that may cause significant harm to children. Finally, it allows the FDA to demand safety information from a manufacturer if the FDA has evidence that a particular supplement may pose serious risks. \r\n', u"\r\nGetting back to the e-mail's claim that a foreign regulatory body is behind all this, we address the claim that:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nThe Codex Alimentarius Commission was created in 1962 by two United Nations organizations, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. It is the body of government representatives and non-governmental organizations charged by the United Nations with establishing a reference for  international guidelines on food law.  However, it has no power to force its will on any nation. Codex standards are voluntary; no country is obligated to adopt them.\r\n', u'\r\nIn November 2004, the Codex Alimentarius Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses (CCNFSDU) reached agreement on the definitions and regulatory guidelines for the worldwide use of vitamins and minerals in food supplements and presented its "', u'" to the Codex annual meeting in Rome in July 2005.

What Canada has is a national health insurance program which is implemented via (thirteen different) provincial and territorial health insurance plans, according to the guidelines of the ', u':  \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAs for the issues raised in the e-mail quoted above:\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nEach province (and territory) has a number of options for financing its share of the cost for its health insurance plan.  ', u' provinces have opted to finance their health insurance costs through the payment of ', u'; other provinces and territories have chosen to finance their shares through various taxes and/or other revenue streams:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe referenced $96 figure is what a family of two living in the province of British Columbia would pay in monthly Medical Service Plan (', u') premiums.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe highest federal income ', u' in Canada is 29% (for persons with annual taxable income over $120,887), and the highest provincial income tax rate in British Columbia is 14.7% (for those with annual taxable incomes over over $95,909).  The typical upper-income level Canadian taxpayer is not in a 55% tax bracket.\r\n', u'\r\nBy way of comparison, a typical upper-income level American taxpayer residing in California pays a roughly equivalent share of his income in federal and state taxes, even though the U.S. has no national health insurance program.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nAs noted above, any broad statement about Canada's health insurance program is difficult to assess because Canada has a number of different provincial/territorial programs, not one national program.  Wait times for medical procedures in particular can vary quite widely across provinces, cities, and individual hospitals, and of course wait times can also vary widely depending upon the type of procedures involved.\r\n", u"\r\nUsing Ontario (Canada's most populous province) as an example, we find that provincial ", u' measured in ', u' ranged from ', u' for angioplasty to ', u' for knee replacements. \r\n', u'\r\nSimilar, median ', u' in British Columbia (measured for the three months ending in July 2007) ranged from ', u' for cancer services to ', u' for knee replacements.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nWe have not found any study demonstrating that doctors in Canada are more likely to issue prescriptions in lieu of performing more thorough diagnoses than doctors in any other western countries are.  An important factor to consider in this area (one which is not unique to Canada) was reported in a 1997 ', u' ', u' which noted that studies have found patients often report dissatisfaction with their doctors if they ', u' receive prescriptions as a result of office visits, even if prescriptions are not the best course of treatment for their health issues. \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nA 2005 ', u' conducted by the College of Family Physicians of Canada, the Canadian Medical Association, and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada reported that "more than ', u' Canadians do not have access to a family doctor." This figure represented about 12% of the 2005 population of Canada.  \r\n', u'\r\nNote that the term "family doctor" as used here refers to a family (or general) practitioner.  Thus the statement "some Canadians do not have family doctors" does not simply mean those persons see a number of different physicians instead regularly visiting the same physician; it means they do not have access to physicians who specifically practice family medicine.\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAs with other kinds of medical care, emergency room treatment wait times can vary quite widely from province to province, region to region, and hospital to hospital.  \r\n\r\nA 2005-2006 ', u' of Ontario emergency departments conducted by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) found the following:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAgain, details vary from province to province, but some patients in some provinces may (depending upon the circumstances) have to pay (some portion of the cost) for medical appliances such as splints, trusses, braces, casts, or crutches, and/or the replacement, repair, fitting, or adjustment thereof.  \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nThe medical history of someone's unidentified cousin cannot be verified.  However, the way this statement is worded, the anonymous person referred to could have coincidentally died of something unrelated to a heart blockage.\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe Canadian government does not "allot" or set quotas on the number of operations for a given year.   Obviously how many surgeries can be performed is limited by available resources (e.g., doctors, hospitals, equipment), so patients have to be prioritized and scheduled, with the most urgent cases receiving priority.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nCanada has indeed committed to investing billions of dollars in a ', u' to reduce waiting times for access to health care:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe broad (and absolute) statement that "waiting lists never get shorter" is not supportable.   As noted in the example of  ', u' cited above, wait times for some medical services have decreased significantly in the last two years.  Similar statistics for other provinces and territories are linked ', u'.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \r\n', u"\r\n\r\nThe medical history of an anonymous friend is not verifiable, but  it is possible that (under any medical system) doctors might delay a non-urgent surgery until complicating factors (such as obesity or smoking) which could greatly increase the risk of the operation and/or significantly interfere with the patient's ability to recover from it have been ameliorated.\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIn general, provincial health plans do not limit patients to visiting only one doctor each for any given medical issue.  Patients may consult multiple specialists if they so choose (with the caveat that each additional consultation will likely require another wait for access).  \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAs the Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association (', u') noted in a 2005 newsletter:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAgain, all statements about medical coverage in Canada have to be qualified with the fact that regulations and procedures vary from province to province.

As to its claims, rather than take them in order, we'll examine them in two parts: whether the U.S. Secretary of Defense owns stock in the company that produces Tamiflu, and whether Tamiflu is effective against influenza.\r\n", u"\r\nAs to the first, it is true Donald Rumsfeld does indeed have stock holdings in Gilead Sciences, Inc., the California biotech company that developed Tamiflu (a product now manufactured and sold by the pharmaceutical giant Roche), and so he benefits financially from increases in that company's stock price. (Gilead receives a royalty from Roche equal to about 10% of sales.) Rumsfeld was a member of Gilead's board of \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\ndirectors between 1988 and 2001, and he was its chairman from 1997 until he joined President ', u" Bush's cabinet as Secretary of Defense in 2001. According to federal financial disclosures filed by Rumsfeld, he has Gilead stock holdings valued at between ", u' and ', u' \r\n', u"\r\nThe Secretary of Defense is not the only politically-connected person to have ties to Gilead. Former Secretary of State George Shultz, who is on Gilead's board, has sold more than ", u' worth of Gilead stock since the beginning of 2005. Another Gilead board member is the wife of former California governor Pete Wilson. \r\n', u'\r\nRumsfeld is in a "damned if you do, damned if you don\'t" position because of his stock holdings, even though he apparently has no say in what Gilead does (he\'s no longer on its board) and has removed himself from being part of governmental decisions that affect it (he\'s recused himself). In a statement to ', u' in March 2006, the Pentagon said: "Secretary Rumsfeld has no relationship with Gilead Sciences, Inc. beyond his investments in the company. When he became Secretary of Defense in January 2001, divestiture of his investment in Gilead was not required by the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Office of Government Ethics or the Department of Defense Standards of Conduct Office. Upon taking office, he recused himself from participating in any particular matter when the matter would directly and predictably affect his financial interest in Gilead Sciences."\r\n', u'\r\nIf Rumsfeld holds onto his stock and its share price rises (which one would expect it to do if an avian flu pandemic becomes a reality, or if concerns about such a pandemic continue to grow), he will be seen to be profiting mightily from sales of a product the ', u' has been buying in large quantities. If he sells his stock and so divests himself of further interest in Tamiflu sales, he will be accused of locking up profits from the rise in share price that has already occurred. (In 2001, shares of Gilead Sciences, Inc. traded in a range between $6.64 and $17.93. Between January and April 2006, its price range has been $53.00 to $65.62.)\r\n', u'\r\nAs to the second aspect of the e-mail, whether Tamiflu is effective against influenza (especially the specific H5N1 strain now referred to as avian or bird flu), the ', u' dismissive "This medicine doesn\'t so much as cure the common flu" is misleading in that Tamiflu isn\'t meant to be a flu cure. Positioning the drug as a medicine that flopped obscures that fact.\r\n', u"\r\nTamiflu does not cure the flu, but if taken soon after symptoms appear, Tamiflu can reduce the flu's severity. As to how well it's going to match up against bird flu, that is not yet known and indeed it may well not be knowable until the time comes. However, it is anticipated Tamiflu will have at least some effect against bird flu, and with that in mind, more than ", u' (including the U.S.) have so far ordered large stocks of it. Such stockpiling is likely going to appear highly prudent if the bird flu pandemic, a worldwide medical disaster the United Nations estimates could kill ', u' does materialize.\r\n', u'\r\nInfluenza is not a straightforward disease, as it is constantly mutating. While media attention has now conditioned us to regard "bird flu" as a particular entity, in truth there are many forms of "bird flu." The one now the focus of so much concern, the H5N1 strain, was first noted in Asian birds in 1997. That first year, ', u' in Hong Kong were diagnosed with the contagion, ', u' whom died. Since 1997, there have been approximately ', u' human cases bird flu (of which ', u' but as the CDC points out: "It is possible that the only cases currently being reported are those in the most severely ill people, and that the full range of illness caused by the H5N1 virus has not yet been defined."\r\n', u'\r\nViewed from one angle (114 deaths over the course of nine years), avian flu is not worth being much concerned about. But viewed from a more informed standpoint about the nature of influenza, there may indeed be great cause for alarm. Influenza can jump species and move from birds (and other animals, such as pigs) into humans. During the process of that move ', u' afterwards, as one person infects another ', u" virus changes form. What at one moment can be a containable and well-understood virus can in the space of hours or days become almost an entirely new virus. For this reason, flus are hard to combat: they change as they are passed along, staying well ahead of science's attempts to contain them.\r\n", u"\r\nMost strains of flu are not deadly to humans, save for members of groups especially at risk to all forms of contagion (e.g. the very young, the very old, and the infirm of all ages). Bird flu, however, is a killer, and if it jumps species and mutates on the fly into a form that humans can easily pass to each other, it could take the lives of millions in the space of weeks, ultimately making the United Nations' projected death toll of ", u' worldwide look like wishful thinking. \r\n', u'\r\nBarbara "the grim reaper may be Tweety" Mikkelson\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u' \xa0 6 May 2006\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\xa0\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n'] @@@

Between 1935 and 1963 she was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Actress category ten times, winning that honor twice (in 1935 for ', u' and in 1939 for ', u').  Many younger film fans, \n\n', u'\n\nhowever, know her only as the titular subject of the song "Bette Davis Eyes" (taken to #1 on the charts in 1981 by Kim Carnes) or perhaps the utterer of the famous line from 1950\'s ', u', "Fasten your seatbelts, it\'s going to be a bumpy night" (often misquoted as "Fasten your seatbelts, it\'s going to be a bumpy ride").\n', u"\nUnusual for an actress with as long and enduring a cinematic career as Bette Davis had, one of the movies for which she is most remembered and celebrated today is a film she made in the waning days of her career, 1962's ", u'? That movie, in which Davis co-starred with another Hollywood icon from the same era, Joan Crawford, presented the chilling tale of a former child star tormenting her crippled sister in a decaying Hollywood mansion. It was the among the final major film roles in the careers of both renowed actresses, as well as a critical and box office success that garnered Davis, at age 54, the last of her ten Best Actress nominations.\n', u'\nCoincident with production of ', u'?, Davis published an advertisement in the "Situated Wanted, Women" section of the ', u' trade publication seeking "steady employment in Hollywood" and touting her "thirty years experience as an actress in motion pictures":\n', u' \n', u'\n', u'\nIt has since become part of Hollywood legend that this advertisement is what landed an otherwise out-of-work Bette Davis the starring role of Baby Jane Hudson in ', u'?, a classic example of the philosophy of seizing the bull by the horns rather than giving in. Although the ad was afterwards touted as being "tongue in cheek," it was perhaps less a display of humor than it was a sardonic (and slightly desperate) expression of the difficulties Davis and other actresses encountered trying to land significant film roles after reaching middle age (with continued in-front-of-the-camera work largely dependent upon their landing occasional guest-starring roles on television dramas).  Nonetheless, even if her career may not have been on a upward trajectory at that point in her life, Davis wasn\'t really lacking for work at the time the ad was published, as her agent Martin Baum recalled:\n\n', u"\n\nDavis was portraying the minor role of Maxine in a Broadway production of Tennessee Williams' ", u' (which she left in April 1962) when she was tapped for the ', u' role, an offer that came through well before the publication of the notorious ', u' ad, so the latter was not what prompted the former.

The "gas out" scheme doesn\'t call upon people to ', u" less gasoline, but simply to shift their date of purchase and buy gas a day earlier or later than they usually would  The very same amount of gasoline is sold either way, so oil companies don't lose any money. \r\n", u'  \r\nBy definition, a boycott involves the doing without of something, with the renunciation of the boycotted product held up as tangible proof to those who supply the commodity that consumers are prepared to do without it unless changes are made. What the "gas out" calls for isn\'t consumers\' swearing off using or buying gasoline, even for a short time, but simply shifting their purchases by a couple of days at most. Because the "gas out" doesn\'t call on consumers to make a sacrifice by actually giving up something, the threat it poses is a hollow one. \r\n', u"\r\nNot buying gas on a designated day may make people feel a bit better about things by providing them a chance to vent their anger at higher gasoline prices, but the action won't have any real impact on retail prices. An effective protest would involve something like organizing people to forswear the use of their cars on specified days, an act that could effectively demonstrate the reality of the threat that if gasoline prices stayed high, American consumers were prepared to move to carpooling and public transportation for the long term. Simply changing the day one buys gas, however, imparts no such threat, because nothing is being done without.\r\n", u'\r\nMoreover, the primary potential effect of the type of boycott proposed in the "gas out" messages is to hurt those at the very end of the oil-to-gasoline chain: the independent service station operators, who have the least say in setting gasoline prices. (Independents are at the mercy of a very volatile oil market and operate on thin profit margins, and even a single day\'s disruption of supply or demand can wipe out many days\' worth of hard-earned profits.)  As such, the "gas out" is a punch on the nose delivered to the wrong person.\r\n', u'\r\nEither apathy or an outbreak of common sense has made previous "gas outs" non-events with very low levels of participation, as documented by these snippets of news accounts from across North America:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nGasoline is a fungible, global commodity, its price subject to the ordinary forces of supply and demand.  No amount of consumer gimmickry and showmanship will lower its price in the long run; only a significant, ongoing reduction in demand will accomplish that goal.  Unfortunately, for many people achieving that goal would mean cutting down on their driving or opting for less desirable economy cars over less fuel-efficient models, solutions they find unappealing.\r\n', u'\r\nAn event like a "gas out" can sometimes do some good by calling attention to a cause and sending a message.  In this case, though, the only message being sent is: "We consumers are so desperate for gasoline that we can\'t even do without it for a few days to demonstrate our dissatisfaction with its cost."

Jokes, like urban legends, are vehicles we often use to express our concerns and attitudes regarding various social issues, and in this context the piece quoted above might be considered "real" in that it does indeed reflect one common viewpoint on an issue of importance to a good many people.\r\n', u'\r\nSecularism and religion have long clashed in U.S. courts, most famously in the 1925 ', u' "monkey trial" which challenged a Tennessee law prohibiting the teaching of Evolution Theory in public schools.  Especially since the 1963 Supreme Court decision in ', u' (and ', u') ruled that required Bible reading and prayer recitation in public schools were unconstitutional, courts have struggled to define the limits of the ', u' stricture that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion" (also known as the ', u' or the "separation of church and state").

In their view, the legal system is being used not to properly prevent the government from promoting or endorsing any particular religion or denomination, but to enforce the removal of every vestige of religion from public life by placing increasingly stringent restrictions on the use of prayer, religious displays, and invocations of God  (as exemplified by the 2000 ", u" decision, which held that a student's delivering a prayer over the public address system before a public school football game violated the ", u' Establishment Clause, or the case of ', u', which unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of requiring public school students to recite a Pledge of Allegiance that declares the U.S. to be a nation "under God").\r\n', u'\r\nAccordingly, this humor piece utilizes a fantasy court case with exaggerated elements to make its point.  The "godless" representative for the plaintiffs is not presented as bringing any legitimate constitutional issue before the court; he\'s simply complaining that Jews and Christians have religious holidays while atheists have none.  (What sort of injunctive relief he might be seeking isn\'t specified \u2014 does he expect the judge to issue a ', u' restraining order prohibiting any celebration of Christmas whatsoever?)  The "wise" jurist\'s hands may be bound by the law, but not so his heart.

Under the terms of that legislation, federal employees may not perform their job duties during a government shutdown (save for certain legally exempted activities, such as "emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property") even if they volunteer to do so on an unpaid basis, and federal workers who violate the Antideficiency Act may be subject to disciplinary action (such as suspension or job termination), fines, and imprisonment.  \r\n', u'\r\nThe application of the Antideficiency Act is open to a fair amount of interpretation, however.

Many critics have claimed that children lucky enough to receive wigs were charged exorbitant prices and made to endure a rigorous screening process.\r\n", u'\r\nBefore examining such rumors, we havbe to consider the scope of a charity like Locks of Love. Hair donation charities have a primary function of raising money and providing hairpieces to people who suffer from chronic hair loss, but their secondary purpose is rather unique: while contributing to most other charities requires available cash, Locks of Love enables anyone who can grow healthy hair to contribute. Because of the relatively low barrier to participation, Locks of Love and similar charitable entities remain popular among children and youth groups seeking to engage in good works. While hair donation is a particularly accessible form of charitable service, the ease of contributing has triggered skepticism and the fear that well-intentioned kids are being hooked and crooked for their good deeds.', u"\r\n\r\nIn the March 2015 Facebook post quoted above, the author claimed that Locks of Love only used a third of donated hair to craft wigs and sold the remaining two thirds to commercial hairpiece makers. Locks of Love themselves say that as much as 80% of donated hair isn't used to make hairpieces directly, but according to that organization and the wigmaker with whom they work, most donated hair ", u' be used because it does not meet the necessary criteria for making hairpieces:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nThe interview quoted above (which took place in 2007) made mention of the sale of hair to keep the charity running. However, such an admission is not necessarily suspect. As explained earlier, the charity functions in part to convert a resource nearly all can provide (hair) into a usable product for children in need. If that need is aided by selling some donated hair to fund manufacturing costs and the charity's organizational needs, the charity's primary goal (acquiring and providing hairpieces to children) is still being served.\r\n", u"\r\nLocks of Love's web site addresses the matter of wig costs to recipients, noting that hairpieces are provided free to families who lack the means to purchase them. For others, the hairpieces are available on a sliding ", u' of prices depending upon their ability to pay:\r\n\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAlso at issue is the matter of who the primary recipients of wigs are. One aspect of rumor states that children with cancer were not primary candidates for Locks of Love, another thing the charity itself has frequently explained:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nWhile those looking to donate hair may prefer their donations help cancer sufferers, Locks of Love was founded by and operates primarily for sufferers of alopecia. This focus of the group does not constitute any subterfuge or lie by omission, as some rumors insinuated. The Locks of Love FAQ also addresses the sale of hair:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nEarlier rumors about Locks of Love claimed that the organization failed to account for a vast quantity of donated hair:\r\n\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nHowever, a number of factors were elided in that report. The value of donated hair when applied to actual hairpieces provided to children relied on a projection, not actual processing and manufacturing costs. Also, Locks of Love must account for their incoming and outgoing expenses each year in tax filings. If the group truly trafficked heavily \r\n\r\n', u" \r\n\r\nin black market hair, significant discrepancies would arise in their accounting books.

That claim predictably caused outrage among Facebook users, with many commenters stating the situation as described confirmed their suspicions about the poor and needy. However, there are a number of reasons why the claim might not be true and how it might negatively impact initiatives to ensure children living in poverty have access to much needed toy donations at Christmas.\r\n', u"\r\nFirst and foremost, we have only a single Walmart shopper's account to go by in assessing what the images depict. The man said he confirmed with the cashier the items were toy returns, but no one knows for sure whether such a conversation even took place.\r\n", u"\r\nThen there's the matter of how retail systems are organized, particularly during the holiday season. Sorting merchandise into carts for restocking on shelves is common practice, and such sorting includes not just returns but items moved by customers from one part of the store to another or abandoned at check-out aisles.  Such items are generally sorted by department, so busy stores are likely to be stuck with several carts per department at the end of a shift or the start of a day. Items moved or abandoned at checkout \r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nthat require refrigeration would be top priority, and items like clothing and toys would command less urgency. So pictures of carts full of toy department items could create the false impression of a disproportionate number of returns to that department, when it's entirely possible carts full of other departments' items were just as plentiful but were left out of the frame of the photos or had already been returned to their shelves.  And even if we were to take the tale at face value, it's still a bit hard to buy because for the cashier's claim about beer and cigarettes to be credible, we would have to assume she was in the habit of tracking customers after they returned items, carefully observing what they purchased with their gift cards. \r\n", u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThere is also the matter of the origin of the toys. Although toys received through programs for the needy are certainly ', u" to stores from time to time, there's simply no way to discern which toys in the photographs shown here might have been received as standard gifts, which toys might have been donated via Christmas drives for the needy, and which toys were returned simply because they proved to be unwanted or duplicate items. No explanation was given as to why the toys in the cart were assumed to have been donated versus purchased toys or gifted ones.\r\n", u'\r\n', u'\r\nIn fact, the store in question, a Walmart on Bleachery Boulevard in Asheville, North Carolina, verified that although the photos were in fact taken at that store, "the claim the toys are all returns is 100 percent not true" and "most of the toys are items left around the store that need to be restocked."  According to a ', u' by local television station WLOS:\r\n  \r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nWhether or not the story is in any way reflective of any factual circumstances, it would be a shame for such a claim to negatively impact ', u' toy drives right before Christmas. The tale closely matches much of the argument against food stamps and other forms of assistance for the needy and has the potential to damage efforts to supply children in need with toys at Christmas. According to Toys for Tots, demand for toys has outpaced supply in recent years, and while the scope of the program is very large, the organization is unable to fulfill all the requests it receives:\r\n\r\n', u" \r\n\r\nThe author urged people to verify whether toys are truly being parceled out to kids in genuine need, but most toy drives are partially or wholly anonymous to protect the privacy of recipients, and therefore such an endeavor isn't possible without intruding upon those who receive items from those drives. In the absence of stronger evidence, there's not much reason to believe the claim is true, accurate, or representative of how toy drives actually operate.\r\n", u'\r\n', u' \xa0 24 December 2014\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

As can be verified through the Social Security Death Index (", u"), a database of death records created from the United States Social Security Administration's Death Master File Extract, the Social Security Administration was in fact informed of Ludwig's death, and the Social Security number assigned to him was not, as claimed, the same as that assigned to Barack Obama ", u' but rather a completely different number ', u"  Ludwig also didn't pass away until 1981, by which time Barack Obama had long since been assigned a Social Security number of his own:\r\n", u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe premise of this claim is also flawed in concept, as Barack Obama was born in United States and thus there would have been no reason for his grandmother to appropriate someone else's Social Security number for use by him.  (Since non-citizens can legally obtain Social Security numbers the issue is irrelevant anyway, as possession of a Social Security number is not in itself an indicator of citizenship.)\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nLikewise, the claim that Social Security numbers beginning with 042 are "reserved for Connecticut residents" is false.  As ', u" by the Social Security Administration, the area number portion of a SSN does not (and never did) necessarily correspond to the state in which an applicant was born or resides; it simply reflects the mailing address which the applicant has requested his newly issued card be sent to.  That mailing address does not have to be the same as the applicant's residence address: it can be the address of a friend, relative, employer, rented post office box, or anyone else authorized to receive mail on his behalf:   \r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nWhy Barack Obama's Social Security card application might have included a Connecticut mailing address is something of a curiosity, as he had no known connection to that state at the time, but by itself that quirk is no indicator of fraud.   The most likely explanation for the discrepancy is a simple clerical or typographical error: the ZIP code in the area of Honolulu where Barack Obama lived at the time he applied for his Social Security number in 1977 is 96814, while the ZIP code for Danbury, Connecticut, is 06814.  Since '0' and '9' are similarly shaped numbers and are adjacent on typewriter keyboards, it's not uncommon for handwritten examples to be mistaken for each other, or for one to be mistyped as the other (thereby potentially resulting in a Hawaiian resident's application mistakenly being routed as if it had originated from Connecticut).\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nAn item from February 2013 resurrected the claim that Barack Obama was using someone else's Social Security number, this time a SSN supposedly belonging to one Harrison J. Bounel:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nThis claim stems from nothing more than the observation that a search of a personal information database back in 2011 showed that the name ', u' Bounel" had been mistakenly cross-indexed with Barack Obama\'s home address and Social Security number.  (This type of error is common in such databases and has since been \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ncorrected.)

On ', u' 2009, Navy beat Army, ', u" for the Midshipmen's eighth straight win in the series.  President Obama was not among those in attendance at the game.\r\n", u'\r\nThe statement above, which claims that President Barack Obama was "the ', u' in ', u' to miss the annual Army-Navy Football Game," implies that every single president since Theodore Roosevelt attended the Army-Navy game each year they were in office.  This is far from the case:  Many presidents took in only one or two Army-Navy games, and several attended none at all.  As charted in the sidenotes of a ', u' of the Army-Navy game compiled by the Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies, presidents such as Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and ', u' Bush were not present for any Army-Navy football games throughout their terms of office.\r\n', u' \xa0\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nThe ', u' did ', u' that a trip to church was "missing from the president\'s schedule" during President Obama\'s holiday vacation in Hawaii at Christmastime 2009.  However, he was far from the first president for whom that was the case.  Accurately determining who was the very first president "to not attend any Christmas religious observance" would probably be an impossible task since detailed, day-to-day accounts of every president\'s activities throughout the ', u' history of the ', u' do not exist, but (if the term "Christmas religious observance" is defined to mean a service held at a church on Christmas Day) several earlier examples of presidents\' not taking part in such an event over the years can be found in contemporaneous press accounts.  For example:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nOn Christmas Day 2009, a Nigerian man claimed to have ties to ', u' attempted to set off an explosive he had smuggled onto Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit.  (His effort failed when the device malfunctioned.)  President Obama had departed Washington on Christmas Eve to spend the holidays with his family in Hawaii and did not return to the capital until ', u' so in a strictly literal sense he could be described as having been "on vacation after a terrorist attack." \r\n', u'\r\nIn a broader sense, though, for U.S. presidents of the modern era being "on vacation" generally means that they\'re away from the White House but never completely away from the duties of their office.  Even though President Obama was in Hawaii rather than Washington when the failed attack occurred, he was nonetheless engaged in \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ndealing with it, taking part in multiple security ', u' about the incident, ordering ', u' of airline screening procedures and ', u', and undertaking a televised ', u' to the nation.\r\n', u"\r\nIn any case, President Obama doesn't qualify for a first here, either, as the circumstances of ", u' mirrored those of eight years earlier.  On ', u' 2001, President ', u' Bush left the White House for the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland around midday to begin his Christmastime vacation, and later that afternoon Richard Reid (infamously known as the "shoe bomber") unsuccessfully attempted to detonate plastic explosives he had smuggled  in his shoes onto American Airlines ', u" from Paris to Miami.  President Bush remained at Camp David (where he received briefings on the bombing attempt) through Christmas Day, then flew to the family ranch in Crawford, Texas, and didn't return to Washington until ", u' 2002.\r\n', u'\r\nA later variant of this piece added a fourth claim to the "trifecta" listed in the original:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThis claim is also false.

The second refers to a process which has been used by some borrowers to keep afloat financially by shedding their under water properties.\r\n', u"\r\nWhen a property owner holds an under water mortgage and can no longer make his mortgage payments, one remedy is for the lienholder to agree to a short sale: that is, to allow the owner to sell the property for less than the amount still owed on the loan.

On an extended road trip, the Volt's driver certainly wouldn't be stopping every ", u' to spend ', u" recharging the battery, as implied here \u2014 instead, under such circumstances the driver would simply refill the Volt's gas tank as needed and skip recharging the battery until the conclusion of the journey.\r\n", u'\r\nNext, the portions of this item dealing with energy-related operating costs of the Chevy Volt are unrealistic because they are based on erroneous assumptions and energy prices not reflective of current norms.  When empirical data and standard energy prices are used, the operating costs for the Chevy Volt compare favorably with standard gasoline-powered automobiles. \r\n', u'\r\nFor starters, although the Chevy Volt stores ', u' of energy in its battery pack, it actually uses only ', u' for propulsion and about another ', u" during the charging process, so recharging the Volt's battery does not typically require a full ", u' of electricity.  As ', u' found during their Volt road tests: "In our experience, using only standard-household ', u' power, it took about ', u" of electricity to replenish the Volt's 9 kWh of usable energy.

Although electricity costs vary from place to place, nowhere in the United States is the average residential ', u' of electricity anywhere close to $1.16 per kwh. The ', u' for electricity in the United States in December 2011 was only $0.127 per kwh.

Hofmeister responded by asserting forcefully that "I can guarantee to the American people, because of the inaction of the United States Congress, ever increasing prices, unless the demand comes down ... and the five dollars [per gallon price] will look like a very low price in the years to come if we are prohibited from finding new reserves, new opportunities to increase supplies."  \r\n', u'\r\nAt another point Rep.

The ability to quickly and accurately track the movement of product through their stores enables retailers to ensure that customers don't find a wanted item out of stock, while avoiding the spoilage and costly inefficiencies that come with keeping too much unsold inventory on hand.  These improvements lower retailers' operating costs, and the savings are (theoretically) passed along to consumers in the form of lower \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n', u'\r\nThe adoption of the Universal Product Code, or ', u' (more commonly known as the "bar code"), in the 1970s was one of the most significant steps in automating the tracking of inventory.  With every product assigned a unique code (encoded in bar form on the packaging) which could be read by a scanner and matched up with information stored in a database, retailers could eliminate the costly and time-consuming processes of individually price-tagging every single item and manually counting items to determine the amount of inventory on hand; instead, prices could be read by scanners at the point of sale, and purchases could be tracked automatically and the number of items sold subtracted from stock-on-hand to calculate current inventory levels.\r\n', u'\r\nA more recent advance in inventory control has been the development of Radio Frequency Identification (', u') technology.  Described as "bar codes on steroids," tiny RFID chips are being embedded in products (or their packaging) to assist retailers with Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC).  The RFID chips, when triggered by sensors, emit short bursts of identifying data streamed via radio waves; this system is a significant improvement over bar coding system for a number of reasons, including:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nMost important, perhaps, RFID chips can enable the tracking of individual pieces of merchandise.  That is, rather than simply identifying an item as a box of Cheerios (as bar codes do), an RFID chip can uniquely identify a ', u" of Cheerios and enable it to be tracked all the way through the sales chain, from the warehouse to a consumer's shopping cart.

(For example, any device which stores data in memory might potentially retain personal or offensive information left behind by a previous user, and even seemingly intact and unused equipment returned in its original packaging might still be lacking a user manual, a remote control, a cartridge, or some other small component removed by a previous purchaser.)  Absent a restocking fee, those retailers would therefore be left holding the bag for merchandise that was returned on little more than consumer whim. A restocking fee passes along some of this loss to the person who caused it (that is, the buyer who changed his mind about owning the item).\r\n", u'\r\nAlso, restocking fees work to discourage those intent upon using retailers as merchandise lending libraries. Absent such fees, someone looking to have the use of a camcorder for a wedding, for instance, could buy the item on Friday, use it on Saturday, retrieve images from it on Sunday, return it on Monday, and get all of his \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nmoney back.

Some retailers advertise that if a buyer can find the same item elsewhere for a lower price, they'll refund the difference, but others expect their customers to do their comparison shopping in advance of purchase. \r\n", u"\r\nAll of this, you might think, would be merely the retailers' headache.

Peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace at a 1969 UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, a day to be observed on the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere (", u' 1970), but the modern ', u' takes place a month later. \r\n', u'\r\nIn the lack of any obvious reason for a chosen date of ', u' as Earth Day, various theories have been floated to explain it, ranging from the sensible (it was chosen to coincide with ', u' a traditional day on which \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nthe public was encouraged to plant and care for trees), to the ridiculous (that it was selected by "Unicorn Killer" ', u" to coincide with the birthday of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin). Since the latter example is unfortunately prominent enough to be in need of debunking, we'll offer one here.\r\n", u'\r\nEver since the very first Earth Day, rumors have been floated linking its date of ', u' to the birthday of Vladimir Ilich Lenin, Russian leader of the Bolshevik Revolution and first head of the Soviet state, who was born on that day in 1870. Just after the first Earth Day, ', u' magazine famously reported claims that the choice of an ', u' date was all part of "a Communist trick" implemented by "subversive elements [who] plan to make American children live in an environment that is good for them." Later commentators have asserted a putative connection between Earth Day and the father of Communism by maintaining that "Lenin\'s goal was to destroy private property, and this goal is obviously shared by environmentalists."\r\n', u'\r\nInto this unsavory brew of notorious Earth Day connections has been stirred the exploits of Ira Einhorn, an environmental activist in the 1960\'s and 70\'s who was nicknamed "Unicorn" because his last name means "one horn" or "unicorn" in German. After Einhorn\'s then-girlfriend, Helen "Holly" Maddux, broke up with him and moved to New York, she returned to their shared apartment in Philadelphia on ', u' 1977 to collect her personal belongings and was never seen again. Einhorn told police inquring into her disappearance that "she had gone out to the neighborhood ', u' to buy some tofu and sprouts and never returned;" it wasn\'t until ', u" later, after one of Einhorn's neighbors complained about a reddish-brown, foul-smelling liquid leaking from their ceiling (directly below Einhorn's bedroom closet) that police searched the apartment and found Maddux's body stuffed in a trunk full of Styrofoam packing, air fresheners and newspapers.\r\n", u'\r\nEinhorn jumped bail after his arrest and spent the next two decades evading U.S. authorities and hiding out in various European countries before he was finally extradited to the United States from France and put on trial in 2002 (after having been declared guilty via an in-absentia trial in 1993). At his in-person trial, Einhorn (who had been dubbed the "Unicorn Killer" by the press) offered the bizarre defense that his ex-girlfriend had been killed by CIA agents, who had in turned framed him for her death because he knew too much about the agency\'s paranormal military research. The jury didn\'t buy it, and Einhorn was (again) convicted of Maddux\'s murder and sentenced to life in prison.\r\n', u'\r\nEinhorn has since been linked to Earth Day in various news reports identifying him as a "co-founder" of the event and/or "master of ceremonies at the first Earth Day;" and accounts of Einhorn\'s crime have played up those supposed Earth Day connections and his environmentalist past by (erroneously) stating that he "composted" his murdered girlfriend. This confluence of circumstances has led to the rumor that it was the evil, communistic "Unicorn Killer" himself who selected the date for Earth Day, and he chose ', u" because it coincided with Lenin's birthday.\r\n", u"\r\nHowever, Einhorn's involvement with the original Earth Day was minor and tangential; and his claims of having had more substantial involvement in the event have been disputed by the accounts of others who took part in it, such as testimony of psychiatrist Donald Nathanson offered during Einhorn's murder trial:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nThe Earth Week Committee of Philadelphia, the group responsible for setting up the first Earth Day, has also denied that Einhorn was significantly involved in the birth of \r\nthat environmental holiday:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nA good many historical events and ', u' (including those of ', u' Emmanuel Kant, and ', u' Oppenheimer) have taken place on ', u' but neither any of them nor Ira Einhorn has anything to do with the choice of that day for Earth Day.

But a fringe objection echoed outside the Beltway, where Brennan's fitness to serve was questioned due to his supposedly becoming a Muslim while stationed in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The claim's fire was fueled after Brennan was ", u' to his office not on a Bible but on a copy of the Constitution.', u"\r\n\r\nThe rumor about Brennan's conversion to Islam coalesced ", u'after a ', u' 2013 radio broadcast during which former FBI agent John Guandolo levied the accusation. The most relevant portion of the interview has been excerpted below:', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nOn ', u' 2013, talk show host Glenn Beck repeated the claim in his frequently employed "just asking questions" style. According to Beck, the assertion was "plausible" simply by merit of having been uttered aloud at one point in the not too distant past, and it was therefore reasonable to speculate as to whether Brennan had in fact converted to Islam:', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nBeck acknowledged he had no evidence to offer in support of such a claim:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIterations of the "Brennan is a Muslim" claim have a single thing in common: ', u' agent John Guandolo. Guandolo resigned from his position with the Bureau in ', u' after he was caught engaging in a sexual relationship with a key confidential source in the midst of a corruption investigation of a Louisiana politician.  Since then, he has created a burgeoning second career training law enforcement groups to identify potential covert Islamic threats to the United States.\r\n', u"\r\nHowever, Guandolo's credibility in this area has been questioned, one example being an NPR ", u' that primarily focused on Jordanian-American Omar ', u' Guandolo was central to the segment due his insinuation during a law enforcement training course that Omari was connected to a vague cabal of "terrorists":\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n\r\nGuandolo remains the sole source we\'ve found for this claim about John Brenna\'s being a Muslim, with no versions of it tracing back to any source other than him. The only thing approaching proof the former FBI agent had cited in support of his claim is the fact that Brennan once said during a speech that he had "marveled at the majesty of the Hajj."  Since the Hajj is an annual pilgrimage undertaken by Muslims to Mecca, a holy city that non-Muslims not are allowed to enter, Guandolo arrived at the extremely \r\nfar-fetched conclusion that Brennan himself must be a Muslim in order to have marveled at it.  But Brennan didn\'t say he had ever taken part in such a pilgrimage or visited Mecca himself, and quite obviously someone with his extensive background in Middle Eastern affairs could know (and have seen) something of the Hajj without having participated in it:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nUltimately, the Guandolo\'s claim is not only unfounded but problematic. Even if Guandolo\'s demonstrated inclination to make claims without factual basis were not considered, his statements constitute a conflict of interest due to his post-FBI career. Guandolo markets the idea of an imminent, pervasive threat to security in the United States has resulted from a conspiracy by Muslims to infiltrate the government at its highest levels and is paid for his "expertise" through his being hired to provide lectures and training classes on the subject.\r\n', u"\r\nAside from Guandolo's shaky accusation, the one other scanty piece of evidence cited in support of this claim is that the movie ", u', about the U.S. intelligence and military operation to track down and kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, featured a top-level CIA character known as "The Wolf" who was depicted in the film as a practicing Muslim and shown praying in his office.  Some who have heard the rumor about Brennan have speculated this character was intended to represent him, but the personal details of the ', u' man on whom the character was based (known only as "Roger") aren\'t a match for Brennan.  And Brennan, who at the time was the White House counterterrorism adviser, was represented in the film by a composite character known only as "National Security Advisor," portrayed by a different actor than the one who filled the "Wolf" role.\r\n', u"\r\nWhile it is true that John Brennan was sworn into office using a copy of the U.S. Constitution rather than a Bible, that fact alone is not definitive proof of any particular religious sentiment. Had he sought to conceal his Islamic faith, it's just as likely he would have opted to use a Bible (particularly if he had no intent to uphold the very Constitution on which he swore his oath).  And if we are to believe that John Brennan is a closeted Muslim, then we would also have to believe that either no one in the highest levels of the ", u' has the least bit of concern about that fact (not enough to speak up about it, anyway), or that Brennan has managed to successfully hide his religious beliefs from the entirety of the vast intelligence network that he heads.

Every year in the U.S. there are approximately ', u' traffic accidents, resulting in about 42,000 fatalities. \r\n', u"\r\nThis is the story of one of those accidents. It resulted in the death of someone you've never heard of, at the hands of someone you have.\r\n", u'\r\nIn May 2000, a two-page police report pertaining to a fatal accident that had taken place near Midland, Texas, in 1963 was made public. It \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ncontained the information that 17-year-old Laura Welch had run a stop sign, causing the death of the sole occupant of the vehicle hers had struck. According to that report, the future First Lady had been driving her Chevrolet sedan to a local drive-in theater on a clear night shortly after ', u' on ', u' 1963 when she entered an intersection without heeding the stop sign and there collided with the Corvair sedan driven by 17-year-old Michael Douglas. Also in the car with Laura Welch was her friend, 17-year-old Judy Dykes.\r\n', u'\r\nHow fast Miss Welch might have been driving is open to question.  That part of the police report is illegible, although two biographies of the First Lady refer to her as having been going ', u' at the time of the collision. The speed limit on that portion of road was ', u' According to the police report neither driver had been drinking, but no tests were performed. No charges were filed as a result of the accident.\r\n', u'\r\nNews accounts from 1963 reported the young man as having been thrown from his car and dying of a broken neck; he was pronounced dead on arrival at Midland Memorial Hospital. According to various biographies of ', u" the boy's father had been traveling in a car immediately behind his son's and witnessed the whole thing.\r\n", u'\r\nThe two teen girls were taken to the same hospital and treated for minor injuries that amounted to bumps and bruises.\r\n', u"\r\nMichael Douglas, the young man who was killed, had been a member of Laura Welch's crowd at high school and her friend. He had been a star athlete, excelling in track and football, and was looked up to by his peers not just for his athlete prowess, but for his personality and intelligence too. By all reports, he was likeable, outgoing, and funny. He was nominated as the school's most popular boy while a junior, an honor that almost always went to a senior. \r\n", u"\r\nThere has always been speculation about the nature of his relationship with Laura Welch. One rumor asserts the two had never dated, but that Laura had been romantically interested in him. Another claims he had been Laura's boyfriend when he died, and another that he had once \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen her boyfriend but the couple had subsequently broken up. (The latter theory is advanced in the 2002 biography of the Bushes, ", u', which states Laura Welch and Michael Douglas had dated throughout early and ', u' but by the fall of that year Michael was going out with Regan Gammon, one of ', u' closest friends.) \r\n', u'\r\nThe accident is difficult to understand in that it took place on a clear night on dry pavement at a crossroads described as "the middle of nowhere," where the view was unobstructed and the stop sign that faced Laura Welch was clearly visible. (The intersection was a ', u' not a ', u' stop.) Yet looking to only weather and road conditions to explain what happened is to miss the obvious: there were two teen girls in the car, girls who were on their way to a party and thus who likely would have been bubbling over with chatter about who would be there. Laura Welch, the driver, had turned 17 only two days earlier. She and her passenger were still of an age when they could all too easily shut out everything going on around them, even the approach of another car and the recognition of a stop sign.\r\n', u"\r\nIn her 2010 autobiography, Laura Bush attributed the accident to a combination of a dangerous intersection, the darkness of night, a less than safe car (on the victim's part), and her own non-optimal eyesight.  She acknowledged that the victim, Mike Douglas, was a close friend of hers but stated that he was not her boyfriend:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are those who want to believe the future First Lady deliberately and with malice aforethought murdered her ', u' over some now forgotten teen tiff and who point to what they view as the suspicious circumstances of the accident and the subsequent lack of prosecution as proofs of their supposition. Yet to entertain such a hypothesis is to believe the young woman would have attempted to kill another by doing away with herself. (As the driver of what was intended to be a murder weapon, she would \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nhave had no reason to believe she would survive a collision severe enough to be fatal to her ', u" events turned out that way doesn't mean that outcome could have been reasonably foreseen.)  \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n', u'\r\nThen there are the circumstances of the crash. It was ', u' on a November night in Texas on roads far removed from any town, so it was dark. With no stop sign facing him, the doomed young man would have had no reason to slow his vehicle even if he had seen another car approaching the intersection. He therefore would have been traveling at least ', u' Laura Welch ran the stop sign facing her, so there is reason to assume she too was going approximately ', u" the speed she would have been doing if she'd had the right of way.\r\n", u'\r\nConsider two cars traveling in the dark at right angles to each other, each going approximately ', u" The span of time available in which to form murderous intent would have amounted to mere seconds, given the speed at which the event was unfolding and how close the two vehicles had to be to one another before the ill-intentioned would recognize the vehicle of her target. It doesn't add up.\r\n", u'\r\nOne e-mailed version of the rumor tries to supply an answer to that inconsistency, saying, "She knew it was her boyfriend\'s car driving south, because of the unique headlight configuration of his 1962 Corvair Sedan."  The vehicles were traveling at right angles to one another, so an unusual headlight array on one \r\nwouldn\'t necessarily have been easily visible to the other. (According to automotive experts, the headlight array on the 1962 Corvair Monza was typical of the cars of the \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n\r\nday; two headlights on each side, as ', u' shows.)\r\n', u'\r\nSo 17-year-old Laura Welch did cause the death of a friend by running a stop sign, but to see more in the story than that is to surrender oneself up to baseless imaginings. Yes, it is always easier to attribute malice to bad outcomes, but that does not mean malice is an integral component of tragedy, especially those involving people Fate later chooses to exalt.\r\n', u'\r\nAccording to ', u', Laura Welch did not find out that the driver of the other vehicle had died at the scene until later when she and her girlfriend were being treated at the hospital. And she did not learn his identity until later still, when her parents arrived and broke the news to her. It shattered her.\r\n', u'\r\nShe was barely 17 and she had taken the life of a friend. She has since carried the weight of this, and it changed her, at least according to those who knew her before and after. Only rarely has she spoken of this with the press (although she has often been asked), but even on those occasions her answers have been oblique, almost as if she cannot bear to think of it, let alone speak of it.\r\n', u'\r\nBarbara "there are many sides to a tragedy, never just one" Mikkelson\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 2 September 2015\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

Upon spotting a veteran political reporter in the crowd and pointing him out to his running mate, Dick Cheney, as the two stood at the podium waving to the assembled crowd, Bush said, "There\'s Adam Clymer, major-league asshole from ', u'." Cheney, also unaware the microphones were turned on, agreed, saying, "Oh yeah, he is, big time." \r\n', u"\r\nNot everyone in the crowd caught the exchange, but many did. It was also captured by dozens of video cameras, destroying any chance of anyone's later denying the statements or attributing their wording to misquoting. What was said became a matter of public record.\r\n", u'\r\nPresident Bush was subsequently criticized both for the remark itself and for the way the fallout from it was handled. When his aides were questioned about the "asshole" comment, rather than offering the candidate\'s apologies for what he had said, they instead defended the remark, attributing it to justifiable ire over particular items Clymer had written about Bush\'s career as Governor of Texas. "There\'s been a series of articles [by Clymer] that the governor has felt have been very unfair," said Bush\'s communications director, Karen Hughes.\r\n', u'\r\nWhen directly asked about his remark, ', u' responded, "I regret that a private comment I made to the vice-presidential candidate made it into the public airwaves," which was not an apology.  When pressed as to whether he would apologize, he replied, "I was making a comment to ', u' I didn\'t realize, obviously, the mikes were going to pick it up."\r\n', u'\r\nIn February 2001, President Bush did somewhat ameliorate his "asshole" assessment by commending Adam Clymer to the Washington press corps as a "major league ', u' Humor is often called upon to help smooth ruffled feathers, which is clearly what was intended here. This updated remark was made in a jovial video message to reporters and politicians gathered in Washington for an annual dinner.\r\n', u'\r\nThe temptation runs strong to compare President Bush\'s having labeled a disliked reporter an "asshole" with Senator Kerry\'s characterization of one of his bodyguards as a "son of a bitch." They were both caught using vulgarities to refer to persons who had raised their hackles, and even their choices of epithet were similar in intensity and offensiveness. (That is not to say the terms are interchangeable, only that they both rank about the same on the boorishness scale ', u' not much worse than the other.)\r\n', u'\r\nYet the discussion lies not in the similarities, but in the differences, which are four: intended audience, passion of the moment, subsequent action, and nature of target.\r\n', u"\r\nSenator Kerry meant his remark for public consumption in that he spoke his words directly to a reporter on the scene in answer to a query about the nature of the spill he had just taken (he and his Secret Serviceman had collided while the Senator was snowboarding), whereas President Bush made his remark as an aside to his running mate, both men unaware their conversation was being broadcast. There are certain observations and negative assessments each of us privately shares only with particular intimates and which are not meant for the ears of others, so there is an argument to be made for President Bush's comment to be viewed as a lesser class of offense than Senator Kerry's.  \r\n", u"\r\nHowever, whereas President Bush's statement was made while he was in a neutral emotional state and not in immediate response to something awful that had just taken place, Senator Kerry said what he did in reaction to being upended into the snow, quite possibly too soon after the event for him to have regained his composure. Excited utterances and spontaneous statements are viewed as \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nbelonging to a special class of comments, the proof of which lies in their being treated as exceptions to the hearsay rule governing admissible evidence in ', u' Most folks don\'t hold others quite as stringently to the letter of what they\'ve screamed at the top of their lungs during impassioned interludes as they do those who have said poisonous, hurtful things well after tempers have cooled. Thus there is an argument to be made for viewing Senator Kerry\'s outburst with more leniency than would be accorded President Bush, in that one might have been reaction, whereas the other was deliberate. Yet, even for those who would want to apply a "heat of the moment" reduction to such explosions, the call for leniency for Senator Kerry under its proviso can\'t be made definitively, because it is not known how much time passed between his snowboarding accident and his remark. (Also, even knowing exactly how many minutes and seconds doesn\'t always help in that such judgments are not about objective measures of time ', u' folks take longer to cool down than others, whereas some are back in control of themselves in a split second. There is no unvarying time standard that can be applied across the board to everyone.)\r\n', u'\r\nAnother difference lies in how the two politicians handled the aftermath of their swearing forays. As far as we can tell, President Bush never did apologize for calling a reporter an "asshole," although months after the fact he did attempt to pour oil on troubled waters by making a joke that recast his ignoble comment into an inclusive "we\'re all friends, aren\'t we, boys?" pat on the back for the man so defamed. As for Senator Kerry, while less time has passed in which he could have made amends for his "son of a bitch" assessment, we\'ve seen nothing further on the subject ', u' reports of apologies tendered nor of remarks withdrawn.  Both men could be judged as receiving failing grades in this category, albeit through different forms of not having admitted to wrongdoing and attempting to set things to rights.\r\n', u'\r\nLast, there is the matter of the nature of those who drew the "asshole" or "son of a bitch" labels, both in terms of those men\'s jobs and in regard to what they as individuals might have done to have prompted such characterizations. President Bush\'s target was a reporter, a member of an occupation traditionally at odds with politicians. Members of these two groups aren\'t expected to feel great love for one another since  the proper conduct of their duties often sets them at counter purposes. The reporter in question had also reportedly provoked his denigrator by writing articles the President didn\'t care for; whether or not those pieces were "unfair," they worked to add a layer of personal dislike to the equation. Senator Kerry\'s target was a Secret Service agent assigned to protect the Democratic hopeful, and unlike the inherent adversarial dynamic between reporters and politicians, bodyguards and their charges have a different sort of relationship, one that is generally far more supportive and forgiving. While frustration is part of the deal for both those being watched over and those doing the watching, there is also an presumption of goodwill in that both parties are assumed to want the same thing; namely, the successful protection of the person being covered. As for what the agent did to provoke the invective, he accidentally ran into the Senator during a snowboarding run, sending them both flying. While a reporter who pens articles critical of a politician does so with a keen awareness that what he has to say is not going to endear him to his subject, a Secret Service agent who accidentally careens into his charge does so with no foreknowledge or sense of ill intent. \r\n', u'\r\nSo what does all this mean in terms of who was more culpable? We leave that to readers to decide, depending upon which criteria they deem to carry more weight. Such judgments are unique to the individual, after all.\r\n', u'\r\nBarbara "determinedly resisting the urge to title this article \'Asshole Lotta Shaking Going On\'" Mikkelson\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 13 August 2007 \r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\xa0\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n'] @@@

It also puts an end to the trouble of having to change one's currency into that of the country being traveled to or traded with, then having to change it back again afterwards \u2014 one simply uses the same wad of bills. And it ends fluctuations in the value of one country's money in relation to that of another: when only one currency is used, a cross-border deal struck for a specified amount of cash does not suddenly go up or down in price as the financial markets move, thereby ruining one party to the deal while dropping a windfall into the undeserving lap of the other.\r\n", u"\r\nOn the downside, one central currency means one central bank, which means one central monetary policy. That means individual countries which have subscribed to such a plan cannot combat their individual homelands' economic problems by adjusting their countries' money supplies, either to stimulate growth in moribund national economies or to put the brakes on those that appear to be racing out of control \u2014 those countries must instead abide by what the group is doing, even when it runs counter to their individual best interests.\r\n", u"\r\nThat covers what's going on in Europe, and why some love the Euro while others view it as a dangerous idea set loose upon an unsuspecting public.

The quote cited above is a typical example, holding that while Jarrett was an undergraduate psychology student at \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nStanford University in 1977, she proclaimed herself to be an Iranian who sought "to help change America to be a more Islamic country" and she felt "like it is going well in the transition of using freedom of religion in America against itself."\r\n', u"\r\nContrary to common rumor, however, neither Jarrett nor her parents are Iranian, nor (as far as well can tell) are any of them Muslim. Jarrett's parents, ", u' Bowman and Barbara Taylor Bowman, were both American-born U.S. citizens from Washington, D.C. and Chicago, respectively; the couple merely lived in Iran for about six years in the late 1950s and early 1960s while James served as chair of pathology at Nemazee Hospital in Shiraz as part of a program that sent American physicians to work in developing countries.  \r\n', u"\r\nValerie was born in Shiraz during the Bowmans' sojourn in Iran; she returned to the U.S. with her parents in 1962 (when she was five years old), whereupon she attended prep school in Massachusetts, graduated with a B.A. in psychology from Stanford University in 1978, and earned a J.D. from the University of Michigan Law School in 1981 before returning to Chicago to begin her working career. We've found no evidence Valerie Jarrett is (or ever was) Muslim, her only apparent connection to that religion being the \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nincidental one that she temporarily lived in a predominantly Muslim country with her American parents for the first few years of her life.\r\n', u'\r\nThe quote to attributed "Valerie Jarrett, Stanford University, 1977" about her "seek[ing] to help change America to be a more Islamic\r\ncountry" is an unfounded one that has no source other than recent repetition (primarily on right-wing web sites and blogs) and that in its commonly reproduced form is too stilted to be believable as the utterance of a fluent English speaker (e.g., "I am an Iranian by birth and of [sic] my Islamic faith").  No news article or document associated with Stanford University records Jarrett as having made this statement back in 1977; and if there were any credible evidence Jarrett had ever said anything remotely like this, it would have been a well-covered news story since shortly after the 2008 presidential election and not a obscure meme that didn\'t pop up until several years later. \r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 4 October 2015\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

Both cases were controversial due to factors of race and questions over the use of police force. Widespread demonstrations occurred following the announcement on ', u' 2014 that Officer \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nDarren Wilson wouldn't be indicted in Brown's case, and intensified when a separate jury declined to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the Garner case on ", u' 2014.\r\n', u"\r\nMany have since inferred Passmore's death went largely unremarked upon due to racial biases in the media, stating Garner and Brown's deaths at the hands of white persons caused controversy, while Passmore's death (possibly) at the hands of a black person had not prompted similar outrage. Others referenced the lack of demonstrations similar to those that occurred after the death of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager killed by a white man.\r\n", u"\r\nIt may be accurate to say ongoing coverage of demonstrations inspired by the grand jury decisions in the Garner and Brown cases mitigated the impact of the news that Passmore had been murdered, and three cases were somewhat similar in that no arrest occurred following the shooting death of an individual. However, one significant difference between the Garner, Brown, Martin and Passmore shootings is that in the first three cases, there was never a question of who caused the fatalities. Garner, Brown, and Martin died in situations where the basic circumstances of their deaths were not in dispute, but the judicial handling of the incidents was heavily debated. (In the shooting of Trayvon Martin, protests initially were staged because Martin's killer George Zimmerman had been identified and located by police but was not charged in the incident.)\r\n", u"\r\nBy contrast, the circumstances of Passmore's death are far murkier. Many accounts reference a ", u' 2014 local news report by station ', u' that stated Passmore had been shot by an unidentified black male, while ', u' simply stated the suspect was "dressed all in black" and made no mention of race:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe report was one of several published news stories about Passmore\'s murder, contradicting the claim a "media blackout" concealed the boy\'s death to further a racial narrative. \r\n', u'\r\nLittle is known about the circumstances under which Passmore was murdered, and WJCL is the only news outlet we\'ve seen so far that claimed a possible suspect in the shooting was described as a "black male." It\'s possible police disclosed information to that news station that was not included in their ', u" about Passmore's murder, or the department failed to update their information with a description of a possible suspect. However, their press release does not mention a black male and does not include a suspect description:\r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nIf any information about Keith Passmore's murder has been deemed credible since the department's initial release, it has not been made available through official channels. Only one news station included a suspect description, and it is not clear how that claim was substantiated.\r\n", u'\r\nIn general, comparing the murder of Keith Passmore with the killings of individuals such as Trayon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner is another example of false equivalency. In the Trayvon Martin case, protesters aimed their frustration first at police in Sanford, Florida, for not arresting his killer, George Zimmerman, and later at the judicial system for failing to convict Zimmerman (who was charged with second-degree murder but acquitted). In the death of Mike Brown, demonstrators objected to the circumstances under which the teenager was killed, the handling of the police shooting by local authorities, the delay by ', u" County prosecutors in charging Officer Darren Wilson in connection the shooting, and the grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson. Following Eric Garner's death, the widespread circulation of a video depicting Garner's final moments and what appeared to be the use of a banned restraint procedure (described by some as a chokehold) by a police officer, and the decision of a ", u" grand jury not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death prompted massive demonstrations which voiced a large level of disagreement with the grand jury outcome.  Unlike all those other cases, however, Passmore's murder was not effected (as far as is known) by a police officer or citizen attempting to perform a law enforcement role, \r\nnor has there been any delay in arresting, charging, or prosecuting his killer (whose identity remains unknown).\r\n", u"\r\nMoreover, in all three of those other cases, the parties objecting to the decisions or events had a relatively clear set of facts about the deaths on which to base their disagreement, and more important, defined targets at which to direct their grievances. While it's true Passmore's death received far less national attention than the deaths of Garner, Brown, and Martin, the case was not completely ignored by the media, and the cases to which it has been compared differ significantly due to controversial factors, including decisions not to indict or convict involved parties. Most notably, Passmore's case is very different in that no suspect has been identified in his murder, and no legal entity can be petitioned for justice in the absence of a suspect.  \r\n", u'\r\n', u' \xa0 17 December 2014\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

The confusion Araud expressed in response to Emerson\'s statements (before the Fox News segment) appeared to stem from translation confusion over what are known as "', u'" (ZUS) or "', u'" in France. While some pockets of citizenry (including high-density Muslim populations)\r\nin France have indeed been identified as ZUS, and the term is not a designator for large populations of Muslims. Rather, the highlighted areas are ones that have been afflicted with issues such as crime, poverty, unemployment, and blight and are therefore targeted for ', u' initiatives.

Outrage over France's ZUS is slightly easier to sell (as no locations are ever specified, and a language barrier hampers reading comprehension for the curious) than a claim the entire city of Birmingham has fallen to Sharia law. Following the segment, incredulous viewers began to mock the implausible statements made by Emerson using the hashtag #FoxNewsFacts on Twitter. The citizens of Birmingham found his comments to be particularly amusing:", u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nA week later, Fox News issued four separate ', u' apologies for reporting the story about ', u' incorrectly, including one in which anchor Julie Banderas offered a blanket apology to "the people of France and England":\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nAs is often the case, Emersons and Fox's corrections did not travel as far or fast to those who saw and believed the claims made during the Fox News segment, and his retraction did not address the claims he had made earlier about no-go zones in France. While large populations of Muslim residents inhabit cities and towns affected by the rumor (and may adhere to religious custom in large numbers), no areas of England, France, or the United States currently allow the laws of any religion to override their own laws.

A couple of White House correspondents, David Gregory of NBC (referred to in the transcript as "Stretch") and Terry Moran of ABC, tried to turn the occasion into an impromptu press conference, but President Bush held firm, stating in no uncertain terms that he was there to take food orders, not to answer questions from the press.  \r\n', u'\r\nAccording to cafe owner Armando Aceves, the President ordered pork ribs and buttermilk pie and autographed a menu.

Yet if Colson\'s account is accurate ("They stayed long after the cameras were gone to greet every child, to have their picture taken with them, their mothers, and their grandmothers, to talk with them, and to ask questions"), this wasn\'t the standard \'smile for the cameras then run like heck\' that has come to be expected from politicians; it was something more.

Do the fourteen years of ', u' have to \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nimmediately precede the presidential election, or can they have occurred at any period in a candidate's life?  These were issues that confronted Herbert Hoover, who, because of his work (first for a British mining firm, and later for the ", u' during World ', u' had spent a good deal of time abroad and returned to the U.S. less than fourteen years prior to his election to the presidency in 1928. \r\n', u'\r\nLikewise, the "natural-born citizen" requirement is not so straightforward either, because the Constitution didn\'t define what a natural-born citizen was.  (The definition of "natural-born citizen" was left up to individual states to decide until the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, but even that amendment has been subject to further interpretation.)  What qualifies a person for natural-born citizenship status under ', u' can be quite complicated, depending on factors such as where the person was born, when he was born, where he and his parents lived, and the nationalities of his parents. \r\n', u'\r\nSome of these factors might seemingly come into play in the case of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.

Since Barack Obama only had one U.S. citizen parent (his mother), and his mother had not been residing in the U.S. for at least ', u" when Barack was born (because she herself was only 18 at the time), then he's not a natural-born citizen.\r\n", u'\r\nA few facets of this claim immediately jump out as being far-fetched:  first, that a sitting ', u" who has already spent a good deal of time and money securing his party's nomination for the presidency would suddenly be discovered as ineligible due to an obscure provision of U.S. law; and second, that U.S. law would essentially penalize someone who would otherwise qualify for natural-born citizenship status simply because his mother was too young.  The fact is, the qualifications listed in the example quoted above are moot because they refer to someone who was born ", u'.

Three officers were shot in the impromptu ambush, one (Vicky Armel) dying at the scene, another (Michael Garbarino) expiring in hospital a little over a week later, and a third suffering minor injuries. The assailant, Michael Kennedy, was gunned down during the \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nshootout.\r\n', u"\r\nDuring the disturbed young man's rampage, streets near the police station were cordoned off, an act that closed some businesses for part of that day. The subsequent funeral processions for the two fallen officers further interfered with commerce local to the Sully District station as large crowds came to line the route.\r\n", u'\r\nAn outlet of the Texas Roadhouse restaurant chain so affected pegged its shooting-related losses at $9,000 ', u' for the day of the parking lot ambush, and $2,000 for each of the two funeral processions that went past the station. Its manager, Eric Rainwater, sought to use the $9,000 estimated loss to offset a $5,000 fine the restaurant had incurred for its malfunctioning alarm system which had repeatedly summoned police under false pretenses. Rainwater sent a letter to the police department\'s False Alarm Reduction Unit asking that the $5,000 fine be waived. "Although this is miniscule in comparison to two officers losing their lives, it did have a major financial impact on our store," wrote Rainwater.  \r\n', u'\r\nThe reaction to Rainwater\'s request was not positive. Captain Susan Culin, commander of the Sully station, directed a memo to her officers "just to make you aware of the situation," characterizing the Texas Roadhouse manager\'s proposal as being "in extremely poor taste," and letting them know that "while we all have to make our own choices, I personally will never give the restaurant my business, or my family\'s business, again."  \r\n', u"\r\nCulin also contacted Texas Roadhouse's corporate office to acquaint them with her view of the request and to juxtapose it with the fundraisers for the deceased officers' families that other area businesses had conducted. Yet it was more than three weeks before she heard back from them.\r\n", u'\r\nTexas Roadhouse eventually sent apologies for the request and made a donation to a trust fund for the families of the Fairfax County officers. ', u' has stated the Fairfax County Police Department is satisfied with the response it received from Texas Roadhouse and circulated a memo to that effect to her officers.\r\n', u"\r\nHowever, that apologies were eventually proffered and accepted and a donation made to the fund for the families of the deceased officers doesn't change that the situation was mishandled by the restaurant chain, or that the community beyond the immediate participants in the contretemps will continue to be troubled by what happened even as Texas Roadhouse and the Fairfax County Police Department want to consider the matter ended.\r\n", u'\r\nAs was the case with the uproar over a Starbucks barista who ', u' ambulance workers $130 for water they needed to treat victims of the 9/11 attacks at the World Trade Center, the error of one employee was compounded by the seemingly uncaring corporation behind him through its ', u' to his act.

Particularly when speaking \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nextemporaneously, he often uses words similar in sound but different in meaning to what he intends to \r\nsay (e.g., "vulcanize" for "Balkanize") or uses incorrect forms of words (e.g., "resignate" for "resonate"), garbles familiar phrases by transposing words (e.g., "where wings take dream"), and makes a variety of grammatical mistakes (e.g., "how many hands have I shaked").  The point here was not to rehash the numerous lists of "Bushisms" to be found in a variety of media, but to perform a sort of investigative experiment into the accuracy of information transmission in the Internet age.\r\n', u'\r\nA common phenomenon in the world of the printed word is that once a public ', u' he be an athlete such a Yogi Berra, an entertainment figure such as Samuel Goldwyn, or a politician such as Dan ', u' a reputation for spouting malapropisms, people quickly begin to put words into his mouth. All sorts of humorous misuses of words and phrases that sound like something that person ', u' have said are soon attributed to him as something he "really said"; newspapers run the erroneous quotes without verification and are later cited as documented proof of their veracity, thereby enshrining apocrypha as \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nfact. Only when someone undertakes the chore of trying to track the quotes back to their sources are the misattributions discovered, usually far too late to dislodge them from the public consciousness.\r\n', u'\r\nSo, we thought we\'d tackle a project to see whether the increased availability of information in the Internet age has had any effect on this phenomenon; whether quotes are less likely to be misattributed when nearly every utterance of a public figure as prominent as a presidential candidate is recorded and stored in one form or another.  As a test example, we chose the "Make the Pie Higher!" piece reproduced above (generally credited to "', u' writer Richard Thompson," a satirist and illustrator who produces the "Richard\'s Poor Almanac" feature appearing in the ', u"'s Sunday edition) and attempted to trace every statement listed therein to its source to determine how many of them were actually uttered by ", u' Bush.  Our standard was that in order to consider a statement to be a genuine "Bushism" we had to find at least one major newspaper article that quoted the actual words spoken (rather than paraphrasing them), included specific information about when and where the statement was made, and was printed within a few days of the event at which the statement was offered.\r\n', u'\r\nIn this statistically insignificant non-random sample of one, we found that yes, the accuracy of quote transmission was remarkably high: All but a couple of the items in this piece could be reliably traced back to the mouth of ', u' Bush.\r\n', u'\r\nHere are the results:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIn March 2000, Texas governor ', u' Bush locked up the Republican presidential nomination, beating out his chief rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, in a rancorous primary campaign marked by personal attacks and charges of dirty tactics on the part of both sides.  Two months later Senator McCain somewhat reluctantly endorsed Governor Bush for president during a joint appearance at the Westin William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh, where both men tried their best (somewhat unconvincingly) to assure the press that they had put their differences behind them:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nOn the campaign trail in South Carolina while pursuing the Republican nomination in January 2000, Governor Bush spoke before 2,000 loyal Republicans at a well-attended oyster roast held on a plantation outside Charleston and mystified his audience when, during his discourse on the need for a strengthened ', u', he made reference not to "mental" losses (which itself would have sounded odd in the given context), but to "mential" (pronounced ', u') losses:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nDuring that same South Carolina campaign swing in January 2000, Governor Bush committed another grammatical ', u' while wrangling a sentence containing both singular and plural subjects, this example occurring (with a modicum of irony) during the portion of his stump speech dealing with education:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nDuring his January 2000 push to win the first primary election of the campaign, held in New Hampshire, Governor Bush was asked to comment on the recently announced merger of media giants Time Warner and AOL, and he addressed concerns over its potential monopolistic effects with some unusual phrasing:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nBy October 1999 Republicans were noting Governor Bush's relatively rare appearances in New Hampshire and were beginning to question whether he had assumed he had the nomination sewn up and could afford to take the February 2000 New Hampshire primary for granted.   When reporters persistently questioned him about that possibility on ", u' 1999, during his first campaign swing through New Hampshire since early September, Governor Bush expressed the notion that the important factor was not the number of appearances he made, but the number of people he reached during those appearances:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nThe misuse of 'misunderestimate' for 'underestimate' seems to be one of  ", u" Bush's more common elocutionary mistakes.  We can't pin down exactly when he used 'misunderestimate' for the first time in a public statement as a presidential candidate; the earliest print reference we could find appeared in the ", u' on ', u" 2000, but it didn't detail where and when he said it.  Nonetheless,  Bush was still using the word (and catching himself at it) after his inauguration as President, as demonstrated by this excerpt from a ", u' 2001 news conference:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThis line is a retrospective statement Bush uttered during an interview about his involvement in a partnershipthat bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nOn Friday, ', u' 2000, Governor Bush was on the stump in Saginaw, Michigan, and deviated from his prepared speech to reassure the business community that he would not support the tearing down of energy-producing dams merely to protect threatened fish species, an issue he had recently covered while campaigning in the Pacific Northwest:   \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nMark Crispin Miller noted in ', u' that:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nSwinging through Wisconsin in mid-October 2000 en route to a debate with Democratic presidential challenger Al Gore, Governor Bush was discussing the importance of tax cuts to American families when he transposed a couple of words in a well-worn phrase:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nOn ', u" 2000, speaking in Nashua just a few days before the New Hampshire primary, Governor Bush was trying to illustrate the economic plight of single working mothers and again transposed (and omitted) a few words in the familiar reference to putting food on the table for one's family:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nSince these words are difficult to quote in the context in which they were offered, they were soon being rendered as the pithier "I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family."\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nGovernor Bush's misuse of 'tollbooth' for 'roadblock,' in reference to eliminating tax obstacles that prevent the working poor from joining the middle class, comes from his New Hampshire campaign appearances in January 2000, but contemporary reports don't seem to agree on the exact words he ", u' there was more than one such incident:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning of the 2000 presidential campaign, Ken Herman reported in a front-page story appearing in the ', u' 1999 edition of the ', u' that Governor Bush had expressed his disdain for racial quotas as programs that "vulcanize" society:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nIn this instance Governor Bush of course meant to say 'Balkanize' (to divide a group into small, often hostile units) rather than 'vulcanize' (to improve the strength of rubber by combining it with sulfur in the presence of heat and pressure).  However, the issue was muddied a few days later when the ", u' reversed itself and issued a correction: \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nWhether the reporter misquoted Governor Bush or whether Governor Bush really did say 'vulcanize' and the ", u" later printed an amended quote at the behest of his office is something we can't determine.\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nThis final item (a misstatement of the concept of putting more money into the hands of Americans by reducing taxes to grow the economy and enlarge the economic "pie" that everyone ', u' making the pie "bigger" rather than "higher") is the phrase perhaps most often cited as an example of "Bushisms," so much so that it was used for the title of the poem quoted at the head of this page.  And it is a real quote, something Bush said during the course of a ', u' 2000 Republican debate (moderated by CNN host Larry King) in Columbia, South Carolina, between Texas Governor ', u' Bush, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and former Reagan administration official Ambassador Alan Keyes:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThis one initially posed something of a mystery to us, because transcripts of the debate prepared by the Federal Document Clearing House and CNN attribute the block of text quoted above to Senator John McCain, not Governor Bush.

Described as "bar codes on steroids," tiny RFID chips can be embedded in products (or their packaging); when triggered by sensors, these chips emit short bursts of identifying data streamed via radio waves (or "RF").  This system offers a significant improvement over the current bar coding system for a number of reasons, including: \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nOther uses for RFID chips have included implanting them in pets to help identify the owners should the animals become lost (a collar and tag can too easily come loose or be removed), or implanting them in humans to encode vital information that emergency medical personnel might need to know when treating a patient who is unconscious or unable to speak.\r\n', u'\r\n(Technically, a biochip is a computer chip made from organic molecules rather than from silicon or germanium.  The term "biochip" is also used more generally to refer to any type of chip implanted in living beings, but RFID is only one of many technologies that might be used in such a chip. Kevin Warwick, a Professor of Cybernetics at Reading University, made ', u' in 2000 when he had a silicon chip transponder surgically implanted in his arm.)\r\n', u'\r\nThe concept described in the text accompanying this photo, however, describes a different type of technology: the smart card.\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAlmost every credit card issued nowadays includes a magnetic stripe which encodes information about the card that can be read when the card is swiped through an electronic card reader.  (In most cases the information encoded is merely a repetition of the account number and expiration date embossed on the card, allowing the card to be more easily read by electronic scanning devices.)  The ', u' technology takes that concept further by replacing the magnetic stripe with a tiny microprocessor embedded in the card. The microprocessor can store information that might be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying that the bearer of the card is its authorized user, providing basic personal data (e.g., name, address, phone number) to free consumers from the necessity of filling out repetitious forms, or providing important background information about a patient to medical personnel.  (Smart cards also have the advantage of being "contact-less" ', u' can transmit data by RF instead of having to be physically swiped through readers.)\r\n', u"\r\nAnother envisioned use for smart cards is in electronic payment schemes.  Rather than carrying around currency and coins, consumers could use smart cards that would be able to tap into centralized systems which keep track of how much each person has available to spend.  The purchase price would be automatically deducted from the buyer's account at the point of sale, conceivably eliminating the need for money altogether someday.\r\n", u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nHere the text goes even further astray in an erroneous attempt to tie smart card technology to specifics of the Biblical prophecy found in ', u' and 13:17:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nFirst of all, smart card technology involves microprocessors embedded in ', u', not people.  Secondly, the uses of biochips in humans and other animals for identification purposes do not involve implanting such chips in the head or the hands.  The preferred location for such chips is an out-of-the-way fleshy area that will allow for tissue to bond the chip and lessen the possibility of any irritation or discomfort to the host, making the head and hands (too bony and exposed) non-ideal for such purposes.  The recommended implantation location for biochips is between the shoulderblades, towards the back of the upper arm (or on the back between the front legs of a dog or cat).\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nThe statements included in the last slide above are all misleading or inaccurate:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nMasterCard did acquire a 51% stake in London-based ', u' International in 1996, and they have been trying to establish a variety of Mondex-based applications in a number of countries in recent years.  However, attempts to launch the use of Mondex smart cards as "electronic purse" alternatives to cash over the past decade have so far been disappointingly unsuccessful, as this ', u' news account of a Mondex test launch in the UK illustrates:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nAgain, Mondex is a smart card technology, not a biochip technology.  Mondex has nothing to do with implanting chips into people, nor are biochips inserted into heads or hands.

Neither MasterCard nor Mondex has reported problems with smart card fraud or announced plans to insert smart card chips into human beings rather than place them within cards because otherwise the "chip could be cut and the information would be changed or falsified."  (Extracting an implanted chip from a human being isn\'t really prohibitively more difficult than removing one from a plastic card, certainly not enough to absolutely prevent dedicated criminals from pulling it off.)\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nNow we\'ve zoomed into the area of the nonsensical.  Even if we were to contemplate implanting the chips utilized in "smart card" technology into human beings, locating them in the head or the right hand wouldn\'t make them any more difficult or impossible to remove than locating them elsewhere in the body.  (Again, this is a rather silly attempt to tie "Mondex" to the prophecy of ', u'.)  Current RFID chip technology does not use lithium-based batteries, nor does it encompass tracking via a Global Positioning System (GPS).

When Hall found out about the modified terms, in order to \r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\navoid jail time he quickly paid nearly $3,000 in back child support (despite, he claims, having been told during a court appearance several weeks earlier that he was all paid up) and agreed to pay the child's mother $3,000 in attorney's fees.  \r\n", u'\r\nNonetheless, Judge Lisa Millard found Hall in contempt of court and sentenced him to ', u" in county jail for some combination of his failure to pay required child support on time, his failure to follow the court's scheduled visitation times with his son, and/or his walking out of the courtroom in the middle of a hearing. (News accounts at the time were murky about which of these factors was the basis for his sentence.)\r\n", u'\r\nHowever, available ', u'court records indicate that Hall was straightforwardly held in contempt of court for failure to pay child support in a case which had a motion for contempt dating back to April 2013 (and a court document briefly glimpsed in the Houston television news report about the case shown above displays a header indicating Hall was indeed held in contempt for "for failure to pay child support").  The information presented in news accounts indicating that Hall owed nearly $3,000 in back child support, and that the child\'s mother had incurred $3,000 in attorney\'s fees trying enforce their court agreement, suggested that this was an long-running and/or ongoing support issue rather than a sudden and recent one.  \r\n', u'\r\nNothing presented in the original ', u' news report on this case actually stated that Hall "overpaid" child support; it quite clearly said that he paid nearly $3,000 in "back child support," implying that he was paying an amount already past due, even if he was previously unaware he owed it, not overpaying an amount he didn\'t yet owe.   (Later news accounts stated that Hall paid an additional $1,000 over what he already owed.) However, under Texas law, for an obligor to avoid contempt charges in a child support case, he must be current on ', u', not just current on the obligations originally listed in the motion to enforce that prompted the hearing.\r\n', u'\r\nEven the most sympathetic explanation, offered by Hall\'s lawyer, doesn\'t claim that Hall was sent to jail for "overpaying" child support.  Rather, his lawyer maintains that his child support payments were not made on time due to a clerical error, and a recent change in Texas law meant that those who fell behind in their payments (for whatever reason) could not avoid jail time by retroactively getting their accounts up to date:\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nAfter exhausting his appeals options, Clifford Hall eventually spent eight days in the Harris County Jail and was released on 2 July 2014.

Antonio's mother reported to police that her son had been killed by two boys who had demanded money from her and then shot Antonio when she did not comply with their demand:\r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nThe following day, police arrested two suspects in the case, later identified as De'Marquise Elkins, who was 17 at the time, and 15-year-old Dominique Lang:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nElkins was also indicted for another attempted robbery and shooting that took place ten days prior to the killing of Antonio West:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nElkins' sister, mother, and aunt were charged for tampering with evidence and providing false alibis:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nThe comparisons in the example text between the killings of Trayvon Martin and Antonio West are an example of false equivalency, however, as the two cases are nearly polar opposites.  In the Trayvon Martin case, there was never any doubt as to the identity of his killer (George Zimmerman), yet several weeks elapsed before the shooter was charged \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nwith a crime and taken into custody, and the local police were widely criticized for mishandling the investigation of the incident.  In the Antonio West case the identity of the killer(s) was initially unknown, but suspects were quickly determined through police investigation and then promptly arrested and charged, with no one suggesting that local police mishandled any aspect of the case.  The circumstances of the Trayvon Martin case therefore fostered the public perception (correct or not) that the case would never have been properly investigated and adjudicated had it not been widely publicized in the media, but nothing about the Antonio West suggested that anyone need "rush to Brunswick GA to demand justice" in order for justice to be done.  The reference to a "hate crime" is also a red herring: George Zimmerman was not charged with a hate crime, nor did police investigating the Antonio West shooting find any evidence that the race of the victims was a factor in the commission of the crime.\r\n', u'\r\nThe Antonio West killing did garner a fair amount of national coverage (particularly on CNN) at the time it occurred, but that level of attention soon waned when suspects were arrested and charged within days of the shooting. In a country that sees over 16,000 homicides every year, only a small handful receive prolonged national attention, and the Antonio West case had no sensational or controversial aspects of the type that typically drive ongoing national media coverage.\r\n', u'\r\nThe defendants in that case did not face the death penalty if found guilty, not because (as claimed above) a grand jury decided they should not, but because Georgia law precludes capital punishment for crimes committed by persons under the age of 18:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nOn ', u" 2013, De'Marquise Elkins was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.

American beef cattle are primarily grain-fed and produce fattier meat, while grass-fed cattle produce leaner beef. Yes, the \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nimported beef is 8 to ', u" per pound cheaper than U.S.-produced lean beef, which definitely sweetens matters for the Golden Arches. Yet, price difference aside, there's still not enough lean beef available in the USA to meet the needs of the restaurant chain.  American ranchers, however, claim that McDonald's leanness standards are too high, and that if McDonald's lowered its standards to a more reasonable level, it could easily purchase all the lean beef it needs without resorting to foreign imports. \r\n", u"\r\nUp until 2002, McDonald's was already using grass-fed Australian beef in many of its restaurants outside the United States, but for food served in its home country it had bought American. It is the single largest buyer of U.S. beef, thus the concern of American ranchers over the potential loss of any of the chain's business. McDonald's says the importation of foreign grass-fed beef will be a test amounting to less ", u' of the beef sold in restaurants nationwide, which is a far cry from the "they are going to start importing much of their beef from South America" the exhortation to boycott lays claim to.\r\n', u"\r\nAdditionally, the references to McDonald's using South American beef in its U.S. restaurants are wrong.  The imported beef American ranchers are up in arms about comes not from South America but from Australia and New Zealand, where government beef standards are even ", u" stringent than in the U.S.  And grass-fed cattle, such as the sort McDonald's is purchasing from Australia and New Zealand, don't have to be given the large amounts of antibiotics that grain-fed American cattle are typically dosed with.  Cows take much longer to fatten on a grass diet than a grain diet, so American cattle are primarily fed grain (mostly corn) to get them up to market weight more quickly.  However, as cows are ruminants whose natural diet is grass, a grain diet severely taxes their digestive systems, so they are often given a variety of ", u' to fight off bacterial infections.

Banks will be able to issue certified photocopies of checks known as "substitute checks," and these copies will have the same evidentiary standing in courts of law as the originals.  (Although banks may allow customers to view and print out images of their checks over the Internet, those self-printed copies will not technically be considered substitute checks even though most courts will likely still accept them as evidence of payment.)

While it is untrue that Domino's Pizza itself has ever supported anti-abortion groups, its founder certainly has.

Intent upon keeping the restaurant\'s following while simultaneously signaling a switch to a pizza-only menu, Monaghan rechristened the eatery "Domino\'s Pizza."\r\n', u"\r\nDomino's grew from those humble beginnings into a business entity encompassing 7,000 stores in 66 countries that employed 120,000 workers and had sales of ", u' in \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n2000.\r\n', u'\r\nThe success of the company made Monaghan a very rich man who would often be criticized for ostentatious displays of wealth.

He does not go out of his way to hide his financial support of pro-life groups such as Operation Rescue and Right to Life, or right-wing fundamentalist causes such as Word of God.

(Not that other wealthy, powerful people don't have similar convictions or financially support controversial causes, but they are often far less public about such activities.) \r\n", u"\r\nIs it fair to say some of the money from every pizza sold by the chain ended up in the hands of anti-abortion groups?

Certainly Domino's itself never gave money directly, and that is the persistent rumor, that the company tithed a portion of its revenues to those groups. That claim is false. \r\n", u"\r\nDomino's used to address this rumor through the following statement found in its web site FAQ:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nHowever, in another sense, monies from pizza sales did flow into ', u" causes via the conduit of Tom Monaghan. It needs be stressed, however, that he was acting as a private citizen who chose to bestow a part of his fortune on the causes he believed in, not as an officer of Domino's and on behalf of that corporation. The money was his to do with as he pleased, just as anyone's paycheck belongs to the person who earns it and stops being the employer's money at the moment it's paid over. That a spendthrift employee might choose to gamble away his earnings doesn't mean the company he works for supports gambling. Likewise, that a wealthy man financially supports causes others find objectionable doesn't mean the corporation that paid him the money favors those causes.\r\n", u'\r\nMonaghan was not the only fast-food mogul to direct some of his earnings to pro-life organizations. Carl Karcher, founder of the California-based hamburger chain ', u" has been very open and public regarding his support of the pro-life philosophy. Once again though, this is a question of a well-off individual choosing to expend some of his personal riches on causes he believes in, not of the corporation he's associated with making those donations.\r\n", u"\r\nBoth Domino's and Carl's Jr. have at various times been the focus of pro-choice demonstrations and boycotts. \r\n", u"\r\nWhatever one might think of Tom Monaghan's selection of social causes, and no matter how one views the question of direct versus indirect underwriting of them via pizza monies, it's all moot now. These days none of the revenues that flow into Domino's reach this controversial man, so no portion of what a customer pays for a medium pepperoni-and-cheese funds the causes he supports.

However, that is not to say it is entirely accurate, because it omits some very pertinent facts of the case.\r\n', u'\r\nAt the end of a school assembly on 31 August 2006, a black student at Jena High School in Jena, Louisiana, jokingly asked the assistant principal of that institution if black students were allowed to sit in the shade of a tree in a square at the center of campus. The official\'s response was that they could "sit anywhere you want." The next morning, two nooses were found hanging from said tree.\r\n', u'\r\nScott Windham, the high school\'s principal, recommended that the three white teens responsible for festooning the tree with those nooses be expelled from Jena High School, but that recommendation was overruled by the school superintendent and board members, who instead opted to view the matter as a non-racially motivated "prank." The three students responsible for placing the nooses were instead given three-day suspensions and temporary isolation.\r\n', u'\r\nSupposedly\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nas a consequence of how the matter was handled (that is, the nooses' being judged a boyish prank rather than regarded as a serious threat), racial tensions flared at the school and in the surrounding community throughout the fall.  (Investigating officials have since ", u' a link between the placement of the nooses and subsequent violent incidents involving the school.) On ', u' 2006, a wing of the school was destroyed by a deliberately-set fire that destroyed several classrooms, offices and science labs.  (Law enforcement officials have since determined that the fire was an act of arson perpetrated by students who wanted to destroy bad grade records and was not race-related.) There were also fights in and near the school, including one in which a black student was attacked by a group armed with beer bottles at a party predominantly attended by whites. (Only one person in that assault was criminally charged, and he with just a misdemeanor.)\r\n', u'\r\nIn another incident that took place on 2 December 2006 at the Gotta-Go Grocery, a convenience store, a white Jena graduate reportedly pulled a pump-action shotgun on three black high school students when they left the shop. The three teens managed to wrestle the gun away from the man (who was injured in the process and was treated at a hospital for his injuries); they were later arrested and charged with second-degree robbery, theft of a firearm, and conspiracy to commit second-degree robbery. Accounts differ as to what happened in that incident, the white victim asserting he was attacked and robbed by the three teens, and the black teens asserting they were guilty of nothing more than defending themselves against a man with a gun. According to ', u", eyewitness accounts provided by those unrelated to any of the four involved parties supported the victim's story.\r\n", u'\r\nThe "Jena 6" attack took place on ', u' 2006 at the high school. During a fight that broke out in the lunchroom between a white student and a black student, the white student was hit from behind, knocked out, then set upon by other black students who proceeded to kick and stomp his "lifeless" body as he lay unconscious on the floor. The victim, Justin Barker, spent about three hours in an emergency room being treated for injuries to his head and face.\r\n', u'\r\nThat assault resulted in five of the black teens involved being charged, as adults, with attempted second-degree murder and given bonds ranging from $70,000 to $138,000.

Two of the ', u' defendants had been part of the threesome involved in the ', u' Grocery incident, which is why their bonds were significantly higher: the bonds so assigned covered both sets of charges.\r\n', u"\r\nMychal Bell, the only one of the Jena 6 to be tried so far, was convicted in June 2007 on a reduced charge of aggravated second-degree battery.  (His conviction was later vacated by an appeals court ruling that he should have been tried as a juvenile.)  The case against Bell was weighed by an all-white jury (because no blacks called for jury duty showed up on the day of jury selection), and there were allegations that the Bell's original attorney did a poor job defending him.\r\n", u'\r\nProsecutors in his case revealed that Bell had been convicted as a juvenile for attacking someone a year prior to the ', u' assault, then committed three more crimes while on probation for that one, which meant the ', u" verdict marked his fifth conviction for violent crimes. These prior acts were taken into account by the judge when the question arose of reducing Bell's $90,000 bond. \r\n", u'\r\nIn September 2007, Reed Walters, the district attorney of LaSalle Parish, explained the rationale behind the charges brought against the ', u' defendants:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u' \xa0 On 4 September 2007 prosecutors announced that charges against two more of the ', u' defendants, Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw, would be reduced from attempted second-degree murder to aggravated second-degree battery.

They never came back.\r\n", u'\r\nWhen the couple had failed to return by the following morning, their parents notified police.  Christopher Newsom\'s body was found near some railroad tracks in East Knoxville that afternoon, but Channon Christian remained missing.  A trace run on Christian\'s cell phone helped authorities locate her abandoned vehicle the next day, and fingerprints raised from an envelope inside the automobile led police to the residence of 25-year-old Lemaricus Devall "Slim" Davidson, where they discovered Christian\'s body stashed inside a trash disposal bin and covered with sheets.\r\n', u'\r\nThe details of the crime as later revealed by court testimony were horrific: Christopher Newsom was repeatedly sodomized with a foreign object; he was bound, gagged and blindfolded; he was dragged outside and shot in the back of his head, neck and back; and his body was set on fire.  Channon Christian was tortured for several hours, beaten about the head, and raped; afterwards, bleach was poured over her body and down her throat, then she was covered with several plastic garbage bags, dumped in a disposal bin, and left to suffocate.\r\n\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n(Some of the details presented in initial press accounts of the crime later proved to be inaccurate: The perpetrators did not cut off Christopher Newsom's penis or Channon Christian's breast,  they murdered Christian within a day of the kidnapping rather than holding her captive for several days, they poured cleaning solution into Christian's mouth to eliminate DNA evidence rather than as a form of torture, and they did not shoot Christian or set her body on fire as they did with Newsom.)\r\n", u'\r\nFive suspects  were arrested and ', u' with the murders of Christopher Newsom and Channon Christian (and related crimes).

However, the devil is in the details, so readers will have to make up their own minds as to whether her conviction and subsequent incarceration were merited or unjust.\r\n', u"\r\nOn 21 September 1995, Cpl. Stephanie Mohr sent her police dog after a suspect named Ricardo Mendez, resulting in Mendez's being severely bitten, the dog tearing out part of his lower leg. One of the officers with ", u' reportedly beat the other suspect, Jorge Herrera-Cruz. Mendez was subsequently deported (he had been in the U.S. illegally), and Herrera-Cruz returned to ', u' In August 2001, Mohr was sentenced to ten years in prison for unlawfully releasing the canine on Mendez, and she is currently serving her sentence in a federal prison in West Virginia.\r\n', u'\r\nHer conviction is controversial. While fundraising efforts in her name present the matter as one of an exemplary officer unjustly accused, tried, and convicted, news articles about this case and other dog attack incidents involving Mohr paint a very different picture.\r\n', u'\r\nAlthough the letter quoted above describes the two suspects overpowered by Mohr and other officers as "dangerous drug dealers," every news story we sifted through referred to the pair as burglary suspects or homeless men. (Indeed, there was some belief that burglary charges were cooked up against these men only after they had been injured at the hands of police. Those conspiracy charges were not proved in court, however.) Supporting the supposition that Herrera-Cruz and Mendez were homeless men making a temporary abode on a roof (rather than  burglars who scrambled atop a building for the purpose of finding a way to break into it) is an account from  ', u' that noted: "When apprehended, the two men said they were homeless and were only sleeping on the roof. Police searched the roof and found sleeping gear, a box for toothpaste, a package of deodorant and clam shells."\r\n', u'\r\nWhat is not disputed in news accounts is that both men were down off the roof and had their hands pressed against the wall when a police dog was set on them. However, even if we accept Mohr\'s account of the event ("Mendez made a move as if to flee the scene. In accordance with my training, I released my dog"), her unleashing the dog is still problematic, because in her testimony in ', u' Court, Mohr admitted under cross-examination that police guidelines call for using force (including police dogs) only for self-defense or to protect others.\r\n', u"\r\nThe canine attack on Mendez was not the only instance involving charges of Officer Mohr's unlawfully turning her dog on suspects. She has had four civil lawsuits brought against her by others similarly treated.

Not surprisingly, a number of such stories published by ', u' proved to be erroneous and were retracted with "apologies" to readers.  \r\n', u'\r\nThis item is yet another entry in that vein of highly dubious and unreliable articles: It quotes exact numbers and charges (e.g., "Twenty-nine members of Congress have been accused of spousal abuse in either criminal or civil proceedings") but provides absolutely no sources or documentation for its underlying claims, nor does it identify by name\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n even a single individual out of the hundreds of Congress members it accused of various transgressions.  Everything referenced in that article is therefore absolutely unverifiable.\r\n', u'\r\nMoreover, the original article is a masterpiece of innuendo and weasel words, such as "Twenty-nine members of Congress have been accused of spousal abuse" and "Fourteen members of Congress have drug-related arrests in their background." Whom were these people "accused" or "arrested" by, under what circumstances, and what were the results of those actions?  Were any of the charges ever proved?  You wouldn\'t know any of this from the article, which provides no answers, just insinuation.\r\n', u'\r\nIf that isn\'t enough to give one pause, consider the fact that many of the charges made in the article would have been extremely difficult or impossible to ascertain in the first place.  How could the writer know that "Fifty-three [members of Congress] have personal problems so serious they would be denied security clearances by the Department of Defense if they had to apply through normal channels" unless those persons had already in fact applied through normal channels and had their backgrounds evaluated by the Department of Defense (which the article states didn\'t happen, since it claims that "members of Congress get such clearances simply" by virtue of being elected)?  And when we checked with Washington\'s Metropolitan Police Department, they told us that they kept no records of Representatives and Senators who were stopped for traffic violations if they weren\'t cited or arrested, so no one could possibly know precisely how many members of Congress "escaped ticketing and arrest" by "claiming Congressional immunity."\r\n', u'\r\nThe writer claimed that "over the past several months, researchers for Capitol Hill Blue have checked public records, past newspaper articles, civil court cases and criminal records of both current and recent members of the United States Congress," but he neither identified nor quoted a single one of those sources in his article, and he repeatedly rebuffed requests from us (and everyone else) over several years to provide or cite the "public" sources on which the article was supposedly based.  \r\n', u'\r\nAt this point the astute reader should be pondering why someone would pen such a seemingly detailed article about the allegedly disturbing backgrounds and crimes associated with members of Congress but fail to identify any of those persons by name, fail to provide any supporting evidence, and word their charges so tenuously.  The obvious answer is that the article was mostly or wholly made up out of whole cloth, and the vague, non-specific nature of the article was intended to protect its author from being sued for libel.  \r\n', u'\r\nThompson claimed that "we did not run a list of names because we could not determine the outcome of all of the cases. Some civil and domestic matters are settled out of court and the settlements are sealed," but that assertion was unconvincing: the article expressed some of its charges as statements of fact rather than accusations, such as ', u' of the House and Senate have run at least two businesses each that went bankrupt."  If that statement were true, those bankruptcy filings would be matters of public record with no ambiguity or unresolved nature to them, so why not cite them?  \r\n', u'\r\nDoug Thompson eventually bowed to the obvious and removed the dubious Congressional statistics from the ', u' series, offering the ', u' that "I did not double check the facts (which I should have done), nor did I write or edit the stories.

At that facility the incarcerated are fed only two meals a day, with green bologna sometimes appearing on the menu. They are quartered in outdoor tents under sweltering conditions, and they sleep on cots which lack pillows. They work on chain gangs. And they wear pink underwear. \r\n', u'\r\nMaricopa County Sheriff ', u', of the "It\'s ', u' in Iraq and the soldiers are living in tents and they didn\'t commit any crimes, so shut your mouths" quote, revels in the sobriquet \'America\'s Toughest Sheriff.\' He enjoys a very high voter approval rating and has had little trouble being ', u' to the post since 1993. He is a controversial figure, vilified by some and worshipped by others.\r\n', u'\r\nIn June 2004 the e-mailed excerpt from the July 2003 ', u' article circulated anew on the Internet, this time prefaced as follows:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nWith one exception (which could simply amount to no more than our not having yet found the right supporting articles), the claims made in the 2004 preface check out. Sheriff Joe Arpaio has banned smoking, coffee, pornographic magazines, movies, and unrestricted television in all his jails. Those incarcerated in his tent city jail do indeed work on chain gangs, pulling weeds for the city and county, clearing brush, and the like. In 1996 the Sheriff put the nation's first female chain gang to work. Although the ", u' account makes it sound as if he did so out of fear of prosecution for discrimination, there was no such threat lurking in the background \u2014 he chose that course of action because it suited his beliefs: "I don\'t believe in discrimination in my jail system. Crime knows no gender and neither should punishment," he said.\r\n', u"\r\nRegarding the claim about airing a Newt Gingrich lecture series on the jail's television system, in 1995 the controversial lawman used canteen funds to buy the Republican House speaker's ", u' ', u' lecture series with the intent of piping it into the inmates\' cells. When asked if he\'d also be providing those in his charge with a lecture series done by a Democrat, he replied in the negative. "For one thing I don\'t know of any," he said. "And some people might say these guys already got enough of those ideas."\r\n', u'\r\nHe is also proud of having lowered the cost of feeding inmates in his care. Though assorted news articles quote slightly differing figures, a ', u' per serving expenditure is the one most often touted. "It costs more to feed our police dogs than our inmates. The dogs never committed a crime, and they\'re working for a living," Arpaio said.\r\n', u'\r\nIn 1998 Arpaio instituted a policy of charging inmates for their meals, levying a dollar-a-day tariff against each of those incarcerated. In 1994 he banned coffee from the Maricopa County Jail, but he did so not because of its lack of nutritional value, but to protect inmates and guards from hot-coffee assaults by other inmates and to lower costs. (By eliminating the estimated 5,000 cups of coffee served daily for 5,400 inmates, it was expected the county would save $94,158 a year.)\r\n', u'\r\nThe one item we have yet to validate is the assertion that Arpaio deprived inmates of ', u' until discovery that such act was in violation of a federal court order. We\'ve yet to locate this order or to confirm that television programming was ever denied those in his care. It is on record, however, that inmates in his charge view only selected programming, such as what\'s on The Weather Channel.

Then in September 2007 he unveiled "moving billboards" in the form of four trucks and eight inmate passenger vans plastered with the hot line number and signs reading "Do Not Illegally Enter" and "Help Sheriff Joe Arpaio Fight Illegal Immigration and Trafficking."

In ', u', Marcus Dixon was given a mandatory ten-year sentence for having been physically intimate with a girl two years, seven months, and eighteen days his junior ', u' the time of the incident (which took place in ', u' she was ', u' years old and he was ', u' The girl was also white.\r\n', u'\r\nThe online community has come to hear of the case through ', u' exhortations to support ', u' cause, and from web sites such as the now defunct ', u' and www.act4justice.com. These entreaties present the matter as one of an overly harsh penalty being applied in a case where little or no penalty should have been imposed, and assert  the sole reason for such prosecution was racism ', u' black teen boy had a physical romance with a white teen girl, and the authorities went after him for it. While that indeed might be what happened, there are other explanations that should be examined and considered. This is not as clear-cut a case as it has been made out to be.\r\n', u'\r\nAlthough engaging in sexual relations with an underage partner is generally a punishable offense in every state, latitude is usually granted in consensual instances where the two parties are reasonably close in age. Many states in the U.S. have "Romeo and Juliet" laws that make sexual relations with a minor a lesser crime if both parties are teenagers. Marcus Dixon, however, was convicted of aggravated child molestation and statutory rape, the former a felony carrying a mandatory ', u' sentence in Georgia. He was acquitted of charges of forcible rape, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and sexual battery arising from the same incident.\r\n', u'\r\nMost accounts of this case recount the horrible circumstances of ', u' early upbringing, stress his considerable scholastic and athletic record, and remind readers if this conviction is not overturned, this young man will not only have to serve a full ten-year prison sentence, but he will forever be branded as a child molestor and be made to register as a sex offender in any community he moves to. While all that is true, the following passage gleaned from an ', u' article gives pause because it presents the jailed student in a less flattering light:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nFollowing Marcus Dixon's conviction, the unnamed girl involved in the incident that led to his prosecution did attempt to sue the school for ", u' on the basis of those two previous incidents, arguing if the police had been called in for either of them, or if the school had properly punished ', u' for them, she might not have been molested. These two other incidents are also not in dispute ', u" school's defense against the girl's lawsuit was not that these other two episodes hadn't happened, but rather that the school shouldn't have been held liable for them.\r\n", u"\r\nIt's hard to know what to make of the jurors in the Dixon case. Did they render the right verdicts on each of the six charges? Did they even understand the charges? At least four of them later said they did not expect such a severe sentence for the aggravated child molestation charge they found against ", u' yet that crime carries a mandatory ', u' prison term.\r\n', u'\r\nAs for why the jury did not convict on any of the rape charges, one of the jurors afterwards reported the jury did not consider a guilty verdict because the victim "didn\'t scream, didn\'t make any noise, didn\'t turn over the table or anything." While fighting back can be taken as proof of non-consent, its lack does not necessarily prove the opposite. How much fighting back could a typical 15-year-old girl do against an 18-year-old,  ', u' ', u' athlete? Would she even be inclined to try, given that she knew no one was around to hear her cries and come to her assistance? Or would she conclude that attempting to resist would only get her harmed even more?\r\n', u'\r\nThose agitating for the Dixon conviction to be overturned see this as an instance of two lusty teens who engaged in consensual sexual relations, something that should hardly be viewed as a crime even if one of the pair of lovebirds was technically a minor (15) while the other was fully an adult (18). However, prosecutors in the case are unwavering in their assertion the sex act was not consensual, and that the unnamed girl was forcibly raped. Whereas many of the popular accounts present the matter as one of an angered girlfriend crying foul and then shamefacedly changing her mind, the victim in this case has not withdrawn her claim of having been forced into sex. According to her account, which police and prosecutors appear to believe, she was taken by surprise while working as a student custodian after school in an ', u' trailer being used as a classroom. She testified that prior to the assault she and Marcus Dixon barely knew one another, and that she had never spoken more than a few words to him. She said she didn\'t scream or cry out for help "because I was afraid he\'d hurt me." Yet ', u' claims a romantic liaison in which he suggested they go to his place, but she demurred (citing that someone might see them together and alert her racist father as the reason for that choice not being on the table), so they instead made out in a classroom trailer after school.\r\n', u'\r\nIn this hall of mirrors that is the Marcus Dixon case I am nagged by two points that might or might not form the crux of the consensual sex versus rape issue. Prior to the sex act with ', u' the girl in question was a virgin. (Her loss of virginity, after all, was the physical damage upon which the aggravated child molestation charge was hung.)   Also, it appears the two barely knew one another. (Marcus and the girl were in the same Home Economics class, yet beyond that no one seems to have pointed out where their paths could have intersected, let alone offered anything that would support the notion of their keeping company with one another as boyfriend and girlfriend.) Many girls want their first time to be special and so reserve it for, if not a husband, at least a boyfriend of some significance. Did this girl choose to have her first time in the ', u" setting of a deserted classroom, with a guy she'd hardly exchanged hellos with?  \r\n", u'\r\nThere are two distinct ways of looking at the case. From one vantage point, a black teen romantically entangled with a white girl has been put behind bars for a decade for no better reason than that someone judged him to be the wrong color. From another angle, a 15-year-old girl raped by a significantly larger and stronger 18-year-old man with a history of sexually predatory behavior saw her attacker sent to jail not because\r\na jury believed she had been raped, but because a jury fortuitously mishandled one of the lesser charges brought against her attacker.\r\n', u'\r\nWere the prosecutors in the case unbridled racists set on imprisoning a black man for engaging in sex with a white girl, no matter what it took to put him away?  Or were they ', u' trying to jail a rapist in a case which (lacking other evidence) would ultimately come down to a "he said; she said" evaluation on the part of a jury, so they threw in every charge they could, hoping at least one would stick?\r\n', u'\r\nThe case is now on appeal before the Georgia Supreme Court. Perhaps it will make better sense of it.\r\n', u'\r\n', u" On 3 May 2004, the Georgia Supreme Court court overturned Marcus Dixon's conviction on the charge of aggravated child molestation (a charge which comes with a mandatory ten-year sentence), ruling that he should have been prosecuted only on the lesser charge of statutory rape, a misdemeanor.

A lower court then ruled that Dixon had already fulfilled his sentence for the misdemeanor charge of statutory rape.\r\n", u"\r\nIn June 2005, the Floyd County Board of Education agreed to pay a $130,000 settlement to Marcus Dixon's accuser:\r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nAlso in June 2005, Paramount Pictures announced plans to make a movie about Marcus Dixon's struggles to overturn his controversial ", u' prison sentence, although the Dixon family has reportedly not yet signed a deal with the studio.\r\n', u'\r\nBarbara "Georgia on my mind" Mikkelson\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 23 June 2007\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\xa0\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n'] @@@

Her Majesty\'s Pleasure (HMP) sentences are imposed only in cases of murder and manslaughter committed by children under 18. In these cases, the judge sets a tariff (minimum term, defined as the period required for retribution and deterrence). Once the tariff has been satisfied, the prisoner is assessed on the basis of the likely risk he will pose to the outside community. Therefore, a killer sentenced to such a term is eligible for release once the tariff has been served, provided he does not impress the court as posing a danger to society.\r\n', u"\r\nThe judge at Venables' and Thompson's November 1993 trial set an ", u' tariff.

"Although the crime of these two young men was especially heinous, they have the right of all citizens to the protection of the law."

The Judiciary Committee was assisted by a permanent staff, on which attorney Jerry Zeifman served as Chief Counsel, and (for this occasion) by a separate Impeachment Inquiry staff assembled to determine whether President Nixon had committed impeachable offenses.  That inquiry staff was headed by former ', u' Department lawyer John Doar, and one of his hires was a 26-year-old Yale Law School graduate then known by her maiden name of Hillary Rodham (who a few years later would marry future Arkansas governor and U.S. president Bill Clinton).  \r\n', u"\r\nA pair of articles published during Hillary Clinton's run for the presidency in 2008, one by Northstar Writers Group founder ", u' and one by ', u' himself, asserted that Zeifman was Hillary\'s supervisor during the Watergate investigation and that he eventually fired her from the investigation for "unethical, dishonest" conduct.  However, whatever Zeifman may have thought of Hillary and her work during the investigation, he was ', u' her supervisor, neither he nor anyone else fired her from her position on the Impeachment Inquiry staff (Zeifman in fact didn\'t have the power to fire her, even had he wanted to do so), his description of her conduct as "unethical" and "dishonest" is his personal, highly subjective characterization, and the "facts" on which he bases that characterization are ones that he has contradicted himself about on multiple occasions.\r\n', u'\r\nZeifman said he maintained a transcribed diary during the impeachment proceedings, which he drew up upon two decades later in authoring the 1998 book ', u'.  That book makes it clear that Zeifman did not like (personally and professionally) a good many of the people he worked with during the Watergate investigation; in particular, he continually butted heads over issues of procedures and legal approaches with his boss, Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter Rodino, and Hillary\'s supervisor, Impeachment Inquiry Special Counsel John Doar.  Zeifman accused both Rodino and Doar (as well as Hillary Rodham and others), without evidence, of supposedly dragging their feet on impeachment and "tanking" the investigation of President Nixon\'s wrongdoings, for reasons ranging from bribes offered by the Nixon White House to help with ', u" bids, to a desire to enhance the Democrats' chances of winning the 1976 presidential election by keeping a discredited Nixon in office until the end of his term, to a plot to keep Richard Nixon from defending himself by bringing up past instances of presidential abuses of power (which would include dirt on the Kennedys).\r\n", u'\r\nA passage from Dan Calabrese\'s 2008 article presents one of Zeifman\'s chief complaints about Hillary, that she supposedly "dishonestly" drafted a brief that argued President Nixon\'s counsel should not be allowed to participate in the Judiciary Committee\'s evidentiary hearings, even though a precedent from a few years earlier had seemingly established that a federal official facing impeachment should be allowed such representation: \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThis passage leaves many readers with the belief that Hillary Rodham took it upon herself to decide that President Nixon should not be represented by counsel during evidentiary hearings, to deliberately draft a brief that ignored precedent in that area, and to personally hide evidence of the precedent she had ignored so that no one could discover her dishonesty.  But nearly everything stated in this passage is wrong: Hillary Rodham didn\'t draft a legal brief that was "unethical" (save that it made a legal argument Zeifman didn\'t agree with), she didn\'t "confiscate" public documents, and she didn\'t do anything that she hadn\'t been directed to do by her supervisor (and Zeifman\'s). \r\n', u'\r\nZeifman\'s book plainly stated, more than once, that the viewpoint that President Nixon should not be allowed representation by counsel during evidentiary hearings was not Hillary Rodham\'s doing; rather, it came from the top, Committee Chairman Peter Rodino himself.  Separate passages in Zeifman\'s book state that "', u' in the committee\'s impeachment proceedings" and that "in April [1974], ', u'".  (Whether such a "right" existed is far from certain: the committee was engaged in neither a criminal proceeding nor an impeachment trial; they were merely investigating whether grounds for impeachment might be present.)   \r\n\r\n', u'\r\nAccordingly, Hillary drafted a brief in support of Rodino\'s position under orders from her supervisor, John Doar.  One might assert, as Chief Minority Counsel Frank Polk did, that Hillary could have taken a better approach to the task and "should have mentioned [the Douglas case], and then tried to argue whether that was a change of policy or not instead of just ignoring it and taking the precedent out of the opinion," but it\'s highly subjective to suggest she was "unethical" and "dishonest" for carrying out the instructions of her immediate supervisor and his boss. One could just as plausibly argue that it would have been unethical and dishonest (not to mention insubordinate) for Hillary to presume to substitute her own judgment for that of her superiors and to refuse to comply with their directions.\r\n', u'\r\nMoreover, Zeifman plainly stated in his book that Hillary Rodham didn\'t "confiscate" files related to the Douglas impeachment case.  Rather, he asserted that it was her supervisor, John Doar, ', u' ', u' \u2014 took possession of those files, writing that "', u'." \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nJohn Labovitz, another lawyer who served on the impeachment inquiry staff, said much the same thing in a 2013 interview with Calabrese:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nMore important, Zeifman misleadingly suggested more than once in 2008 that he had fired Hillary from her position on the impeachment inquiry staff.  For example, he stated in a February 2008 article he wrote for Accuracy in Media that:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAnd during a ', u' 2008 appearance with syndicated radio talk show host Neal Boortz, Zeifman said:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nBut as noted above, Zeifman had no authority to "terminate" Hillary.  They were members of different staffs, and Zeifman had no hiring or firing authority over members of the Impeachment Inquiry staff for which Hillary worked. (That authority rested with Special Counsel John Doar and, ultimately, with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter Rodino.)  Quite tellingly, Zeifman made absolutely no mention of having "fired" or "terminated" Hillary Rodham, nor of telling her that he "could not recommend her for any further positions," in his 1995 book; he only started claiming so much later. Back in 1995 he noted that Hillary had remained with the inquiry staff up until the end, leaving only when President Nixon\'s August 1974 resignation made the issue of impeachment moot and the Judiciary Committee\'s impeachment inquiry staff was therefore disbanded:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAnd again in 1998, Zeifman was undeniably quoted in a Scripps Howard News Service ', u' as confirming that not only did he not "fire" Hillary, but that it was not even within his power to do so:\r\n\r\n', u' \r\n\r\nZeifman makes no bones about having an ax to grind with Hillary Clinton (putting out the anti-Clinton paperback ', u' in 2006), and as its blades have grown sharper over the years, he has quite obviously shifted his recollections of events from the ', u' timeframe to conform to his current point of view rather than the other way around.  \r\n', u"\r\nBack in April 2008, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign site responded to Zeifman's claims by asserting:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nThey also noted that the ', u"'s ", u" found (as we did) much of Zeifman's book to be mere repetition of speculation with little or no evidence to substantiate it:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\n', u' \xa0 12 April 2015\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

In general, for a song to receive significant radio play it needs to be issued as a single and to have substantial promotional backing from the releasing label, but  "In God We Still Trust" evidently satisfied neither of those requirements.  It wasn\'t released at all (in any format) until it \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nappeared as one of the four new songs included on Diamond Rio's ", u' CD in ', u' and even then it was primarily an album track, not a single that was being sent to radio stations and promoted for airplay. The claim that "Major radio stations wouldn\'t play it because it was considered politically incorrect; consequently, the song was never released to the public" therefore puts the cart before the horse: a song generally needs to be released ', u' it can receive widespread airplay on major radio stations, not ', u'\r\n', u'\r\nWhen "In God We Still Trust" ', u' finally released, it had to compete for airplay in the wake of several other similarly-themed songs from prominent recording artists, such as Toby Keith\'s "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue" and "American Soldier," Brooks and Dunn\'s "Believe,"  Carrie Underwood\'s "Jesus Take the Wheel," and Brad Paisley\'s "When I Get Where I\'m Going."  Listeners apparently didn\'t find the Diamond Rio song distinctive or appealing enough to make it stand out from a crowd of kindred songs and prompt additional requests for airplay, ', u' a lot of other ', u' quietly faded off of radio playlists without having achieved even minor hit status.  Its lack of airplay wasn\'t due to "political incorrectness," but rather to bad timing and getting lost in the shuffle.\r\n', u'\r\nHowever, "In God We Still Trust" was the subject of a somewhat similar controversy three years later, in March 2009, when students at a Florida elementary school were rehearsing the song to perform it as part of an end-of-the year school assembly.   The parents of two students filed a lawsuit against the school board maintaining that the school had violated their children\'s First Amendment rights "by making them choose between practicing a \'proselytizing\' and \'sectarian\' country music song or sitting out the entire performance."  A ', u" Judge issued an injunction against the song's performance at the school assembly, although it had already been dropped from the program by then.\r\n", u'\r\nAny suggestion of a connection between President Obama and the alleged radio "censorship" of "In God We Still Trust" is completely specious, as Diamond Rio\'s recording of the song was released over two and a half years before Barack Obama took office as President of the United States.\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 15 July 2014\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

It states that its objective is to "reinstate Pledge to the Flag in public schools," but the Pledge of Allegiance hasn\'t really been removed from public schools, nor does the petition outline the means by which by the Pledge should be "restored" if it were indeed in need of restoration.  Most likely the issue is confused due to some outdated or erroneous understandings of recent court rulings in this \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\narea.\r\n', u'\r\nIn 2002, Sacramento attorney Michael Newdow, acting on behalf of his daughter, initiated a legal challenge to the constitutionality of public school-sanctioned recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, maintaining that the inclusion of the phrase "under God" (added to the pledge in 1954) violated the first amendment\'s prohibition against governmental establishment of religion.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit initially decided in his favor, but in 2004 the Supreme Court ruled that as a non-custodial parent, ', u" did not have valid legal standing to bring the challenge on behalf of his daughter and dismissed the appellate court's ruling.\r\n", u'\r\nSince the Supreme Court did not issue a ruling on the underlying constitutional issue, however, they left open the possibility that someone else (with proper legal standing) could bring a similar suit, and in 2005 two families (represented by Michael Newdow) did so.  In ', u' ', u' Judge Lawrence Karlton issued a ruling in their favor, declaring that public school-led recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance violates schoolchildren\'s constitutional right to be "free from a coercive requirement to affirm God."  However, Judge Karlton\'s ruling is currently limited to three Sacramento-area school districts.\r\n', u'\r\nSo, for now the only area in which the Pledge of Allegiance is in need of being "restored" is a handful of public schools in the Sacramento area.  Moreover, whether the most recent ruling regarding the Pledge is overturned or expanded is a matter to be decided by federal courts or by Congress and the state legislatures (should someone propose a constitutional amendment to settle the issue).  Sending a petition to the President is one way to try to ensure the chief executive is aware of public opinion, but he has little power to resolve the issue being addressed (save indirectly by appointing federal judges or influencing Congressional votes).\r\n', u'\r\nThose who wish to ensure the continued recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools would probably be better served by expressing their concerns directly to their state legislators and Congressional representatives.\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 9 January 2006\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\xa0\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n'] @@@

Some were further charged with felonies.\r\n', u'\r\nIn the autumn of 2004, charges were dismissed against seven of the original group, leaving four still to have their day in court.

On ', u' 2005, all charges against these remaining four defendants were thrown out. Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Pamela Dembe said that the demonstrators simply had been exercising their First Amendment rights. \r\nCalling the United States "one of the very few countries that protect unpopular speech," Dembe said that the Supreme Court has ruled that the antagonistic reaction of a crowd, even a possible riot, was not reason enough to arrest speakers in a public setting. \r\n', u'\r\nThe e-mail quoted above (which was penned by Donald E. Wildmon, Founder and Chairman of the ', u') positions the incident as a "travesty of justice" perpetuated on Bible-loving Christians by those looking to pander to homosexuals. That sentiment is echoed by other evangelical groups who judge that the free-speech rights of gays and lesbians are being upheld at the expense of those of Christians.\r\n', u'\r\n"Pennsylvania Christians Face 47 Years in Prison for Reading the Bible in Public," the title most often accorded the ', u' calls to mind mental images of God-fearing folk rounded up and thrown in jail for quietly partaking of a bit of Scripture as they munched on their noontime sandwiches in a public park before heading back to work. Yet that was not the case of it \u2014 the "crime" the eleven were arrested for had nothing to do with Bible reading but everything to do with being disruptive of the peaceable assembly of others to the point that it looked like they were attempting to incite a riot. The confrontation that took place between the ', u' and those attending OutFest did not come about through the mechanism of two disparate groups accidentally finding themselves in the same place at the same time. OutFest is a large, well-organized event, heavily advertised in advance. Previous OutFests had attracted similar proselytizing, and ', u" (a Philadelphia-based organization that encourages Christians to go out into the streets to proclaim the word of God to sinners) was behind this particular group of believers' being dispatched to OutFest in 2004. The eleven were there not by chance and not through lack of design, but deliberately. They wanted to preach to the homosexuals, whom they regard as Hell-bound sinners.\r\n", u'\r\nVolunteer OutFest security workers (known as "Pink Angels") surrounded the evangelicals and used whistles to drown out their preaching. They held up pink styrofoam boards to block the protesters from view. The ', u" claimed these acts violated their right of free speech and pointed to excerpts from film taken by Enough Said Productions (which had been there that day to shoot a documentary) as proof of their charges. Yet police had a videotape of their own which they said demonstrated the proselytizing Christians were disorderly and did indeed fail to obey the officers' orders.\r\n", u'\r\nGroups such as the American Family Association and Repent America regard homosexuals as sinners in dire need of salvation lest their lifestyle choices doom them to spending eternity sorrowing in a lake of fire. Judged from that understanding, their acts are compassionate in that by preaching to the Hell-bound, they are looking to spare their fellow man from untold horror. Yet even if their assessment of homosexuality as a sin is accurate, is heckling the right way to go about bringing ', u" souls to Jesus? Or does a good act performed evilly itself become evil? Others are clearly also pondering that question, as evidenced by these comments from veteran newsman Bill O'Reilly, who said the following during a January 2005 interview with Brian Fahling and Chuck Volz, lawyers representing both sides of the legal matters facing the remaining four defendants:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nBarbara "what would Jesus have done?"

Perhaps they are best described to others as "based on" a true story, an appellation that conveys a message of truth\'s having been stretched or recast into different forms to make a more tellable story than a pure narration of the facts would have provided.\r\n', u'\r\nThe facts of the story are these: The incident the ', u' is based upon took place on ', u' 2001 during the commencement exercises at Washington Community High School in Washington, Illinois. With the help of the ACLU, the family of Natasha Appenheimer, that year\'s valedictorian, brought suit to prevent the inclusion of the invocation and benediction traditionally given at the school\'s commencement ceremony. The suit was decided in the favor of the Appenheimers when, three days before the ceremony, the court handed down a temporary injunction barring the inclusion of the prayers on the basis of their having been deemed "school sponsored" (and thereby an unconstitutional violation of the first amendment\'s "establishment clause").  Though the school had said it would contest the ruling that barred it from sponsoring prayer at its graduation ceremonies, it dropped such plans in ', u' once it came to some appreciation of how much such a legal battle might cost.\r\n', u'\r\nPeople were angered by the decision, which overturned a tradition of ', u" standing at Washington Community High. Many found unique ways of protesting the judge's ruling. Before the ceremony, students organized a prayer vigil around the school's flagpole. Some ", u' clasped hands in a circle while about ', u' and members of the community encircled them.

The plan was carried out as envisioned, with everyone who had been in on it playing their assigned parts. ', u' also made another protest on his way to the podium: he stopped to bow in silent prayer, an act that prompted the audience to stand and applaud. He replied to the crowd, "Don\'t applaud for me, applaud for God.")\r\n', u"\r\nA month after the commencement, the online account that is the meat of this article began to circulate. In that embellished version, the speaker's sneeze was cast as being accidental, and the response it provoked spontaneously and unthinkingly issued from each of the graduating students almost as if they had spoken with one voice. This marked a tremendous departure from the truth, as the actual sneeze had been faked and the benediction (which was pronounced by only those few of the graduating seniors who were in on the plan) had been scripted. There was no spontaneity to the act, no unwilled inescapable ", u' that prompted the unpremeditated yet socially-obligated reply of "Bless you!" \u2014 that repositioning of the event was authorial embroidery. (As to why we routinely salute in such fashion those who sneeze, our article about the origin of this ', u' tells all.)\r\n', u'\r\nThat June 2001 fictionalization presented the sneeze and response as fortuitous accidents and asserted that the whole graduating class imparted the blessing, which represented two major strayings from the truth.

However, once this outer sleeve is removed, no warnings are visible, and the contents of the publication are not identifiable from its cover.

Here we\'ve described only the photographs that depict instances of what we would consider nudity.  (Despite the claims made in the article quoted at the head of this page, we found no photographs of "men kissing" anywhere in the "Christmas Field Guide.")\r\n', u"\r\nSome of the catalog's non-pictorial pages also encompass sexually-oriented themes.

All I see is boobies, boobies, boobies and the occasional buttocks. I want some penises. Thank you for your time. Please consider putting in some penises. Have a great day!")\r\n', u'\r\nWhat to make of all this? Whether something like the ', u' "Christmas Field Guide" is offensive depends upon one\'s values.  Some people feel it\'s never appropriate to use nudity and sexual suggestiveness in advertising, regardless of the product being sold or the age of the target audience.  Others don\'t have an issue with this type of advertising as long as it\'s restricted to venues where only adults are likely to see it (e.g., adult magazines whose sales are restricted by age).  Some consumers believe it wrong for a company to employ sexually-oriented advertising for adult products if they also market children\'s products as well.

Nonetheless, available documentation and personal memories have enabled writers to reconstruct the essential elements of the tale. \r\n', u"\r\nThe saga began when an eighteen-year-old Bill Clinton entered Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in the fall of 1964.  As required by law of all 18-year-old males at the time, Clinton registered with the Selective Service System on ", u' 1964, and on ', u' 1964 he was assigned a ', u' (student deferment) classification by Garland County [Arkansas] Draft Board ', u'\r\n', u'\r\nAs \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican military involvement in Vietnam escalated in the mid-1960s, Clinton (like other male students his age) would reasonably have expected that his status as a college student would provide him with deferments from the draft for several more years, especially when in his senior year he was one of thirty-two American men selected to receive Rhodes Scholarships to study at Oxford University in England.  However, on ', u' 1968 the federal government eliminated draft deferments for most graduate students, and Clinton would therefore no longer be eligible for additional student deferments after he completed his final term at Georgetown in the spring of 1968.  Accordingly, his draft board reclassified him ', u' (available immediately for military service) on ', u' 1968.\r\n', u'\r\nIn mid-1968 Clinton, who maintained that although he was not opposed to the military or war in general he was morally opposed to the Vietnam War in particular, began to seek ways of avoiding the draft.  His first opportunity was provided through the political and social connections of Raymond Clinton, his uncle, and Henry Britt, a Hot Springs lawyer and former judge, who made arrangements with the commanding officer of the local Naval Reserve unit, Trice Ellis, to secure a billet for Clinton in the naval reserve:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe "other way" that had "taken care" of Clinton was a favor Henry Britt worked out with ', u' Armstrong, chairman of the Garland County draft board, a favor that would provide Clinton with only temporary protection from the draft but would allow him to at least start his first year at Oxford without committing him to military service:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nAs Clinton biographer David Maraniss pointed out, although the deliberate delay in issuing Clinton's draft notice was undeniably a case of special treatment, it was by no means an unusual consideration granted to Rhodes Scholars:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nClinton set sail from New York to begin his first year at Oxford in ', u'  At the end of his first term in December, Clinton received a notice from the Selective Service instructing him to undergo an armed forces physical examination at a U.S. air base near London, which he took (and passed) on ', u' 1969.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n  An Order to Report for Induction from the Garland County Draft Board followed three months later, but because the notice had been sent to England via surface mail it was late in arriving, and the assigned reporting date had already passed.  Clinton had begun another school term by then (the academic year at Oxford consisted of three terms rather than two semesters), and the regulations allowed students who received draft notices to finish out their current terms before reporting, but he would be obligated to report for induction after the end of the spring term unless he found an alternative before his new reporting date of ', u' 1969.\r\n', u"\r\nAs Clinton headed home for Arkansas from England, his options for avoiding the draft were limited. He did not qualify for conscientious objector status because he did not have a history of opposing military service or war in general, only the Vietnam War specifically.  The local Army National Guard and Reserve units were full.  He took physicals for the Air Force and Navy officer programs but failed them both.  (He was undersize and didn't possess the visual acuity required for the Air Force program, and he failed the Navy exam due to substandard hearing.)  Clinton's only available out seemed to be joining the advanced ROTC program at the University of Arkansas, which had no quotas and was open to graduate students, but since Clinton had already received an induction notice he would have to obtain the approval of Willard Hawkins, the state Selective Service director (an appointee of the Arkansas governor) to enter the program.  \r\n", u"\r\nClinton called upon Cliff Jackson, an Arkansas College graduate who had been Clinton's acquaintance at Oxford and was now working for the state Republican party, and Jackson in turn asked his boss, the head of the Arkansas Republican party, to arrange a meeting between Clinton and Selective Service director Hawkins.  Clinton also received assistance from Lee Williams, an aide to ", u' ', u" Fulbright of Arkansas (for whom Clinton had worked as a staffer while attending Georgetown University). Williams, a University of Arkansas Law School graduate himself, contacted the director of the university's ROTC program, Colonel ", u' Holmes, to help get Clinton enrolled.   After "an extensive, approximately two-hour interview," Colonel Holmes agreed to accept Clinton into the ROTC program on ', u" 1969 (a mere eleven days before Clinton's ", u" induction deadline), although Clinton would not actually be able to begin the program until he completed the basic training camp the following summer.  Clinton's draft notice was nullified, and his draft board reclassified him ", u' (reservist deferment) on ', u' 1969. \r\n', u' \r\nClinton apparently did intend to begin attending the University of Arkansas Law School that fall, but sometime during the summer he changed his mind and decided to return for a second year at Oxford instead:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nThe details of Clinton's subsequent actions and decisions are murky, but sometime after returning to Oxford that fall (where he later helped organize anti-war protests in London), probably between ", u' and ', u' 1969,  he changed his mind again and asked his draft board to drop his ROTC deferment and reclassify him ', u'.  Given recent policy changes (and rumors of upcoming policy changes) by the Nixon administration at that time (graduate students who received induction notices were now allowed to finish out their school years rather than just the current terms; Nixon was said to be considering withdrawing 35,000 troops from Vietnam, temporarily suspending the draft, and changing the draft requirements so that only 19-year-olds would be called, and only "those draftees who volunteered for service there" would be shipped to Vietnam; and the administration was reportedly pushing for a draft lottery system based on birthdates which would expose eligible men to the draft for one year only), Clinton may have calculated that he was not risking much by opting to drop his ROTC commitment in favor of a ', u' classification.  As biographer David Maraniss surmised:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nWhen the first ', u' of the Vietnam era was held on ', u" 1969, Clinton's birthdate of ", u' was selected 311th, a number high enough to practically guarantee that he would not be drafted (and indeed he was not).  A few days later, Clinton sat down and wrote the now-infamous ', u' to Colonel Holmes explaining his reasons for reneging on his agreement to enter the University of Arkansas and its ROTC program.\r\n', u'\r\nThat Bill Clinton went to great lengths to avoid the ', u' draft, that he used political connections to obtain special favors, and that he made promises and commitments which he later failed to honor, are all beyond dispute.  However, the timeline quoted above jumps the tracks when it labels Clinton a "felon," because none of his actions, no matter how unethical or morally questionable they might have been, were illegal.  When Clinton agreed in July of 1969 to enter the advanced ROTC program at the University of Arkansas, his draft board rescinded his induction notice and reclassified him with a reservist\'s deferment.

It is unlikely that such a relatively small amount of residual E15 mixed into a gas tank of E10 could cause problems for standard automobiles, but it may potentially be an issue for gasoline-powered \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nvehicles and equipment with smaller fuel tanks, such as motorcycles, ATVs, chain saws, and lawn mowers.  The EPA initially considered heading off this potential issue by imposing a requirement that E10 customers purchase a minimum of four gallons of gas at stations using blender pumps that dispense E10 and E15 through the same hose, but that proposal has since been dropped in favor of requiring labeling on blender pumps stating that such pumps are solely for passenger cars and trucks.\r\n', u'\r\nAt the end of 2013, the EPA announced it was reducing the amount of ethanol that must be blended into gasoline in 2014 (in part because the overall demand for gasoline in the U.S. has dropped), requiring transportation fuel companies to blend ', u" gallons of ethanol into the nation's fuel supply in 2014, down from ", u" gallons in 2013.

According to it, there have been close to fifty suspicious deaths of colleagues, advisors and citizens who were about to testify against the Clintons, with the unstated implication that Bill Clinton or his henchmen were behind each untimely \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ndemise.\r\n', u"\r\nWe shouldn't have to tell anyone not to believe this claptrap, but we will anyway. In a frenzied media climate where the Chief Executive couldn't boff a White House intern without the whole world finding out every niggling detail of each encounter and demanding his removal from office, are we seriously to believe the same man had been having double handfuls of detractors and former friends murdered with impunity?\r\n", u'\r\nDon\'t be swayed by the number of names listed on screeds like this. Any public figure is bound to have a much wider circle of acquaintance than an ordinary citizen would. Moreover, the acquaintanceship is often one-sided: though many of the people enumerated on this list might properly claim to have "known" Clinton, he wouldn\'t know or remember having met a great number of them. \r\n', u'\r\n"Body count" lists are not a new phenomenon.  Lists documenting all the allegedly "suspicious" deaths of persons connected with the assassination of ', u' Kennedy have been circulating for decades, and the same techniques used to create and spread the JFK lists have been employed in the Clinton version:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nMultiple versions of this "body count" list have been circulating online for nearly two decades now. New victim names are routinely added and old ones taken off, forming an endless variety of permutations. At this point, there is no one "official" list. \r\n', u'\r\nBut where did all this craziness start? In a 1994 letter to congressional leaders, former ', u' Dannemeyer listed ', u' with some connection to Clinton who had died "under other than natural circumstances" and called for hearings on the matter.\r\n', u'\r\nDannemeyer\'s list of "suspicious deaths" was largely taken from one compiled by Linda Thompson, an Indianapolis lawyer who in 1993 quit her year-old general practice to run her American Justice Federation, a ', u' group that promotes ', u' causes and various conspiracy theories through a shortwave radio program, a computer bulletin board, and sales of its newsletter and videos. \r\n', u'\r\nHer list, called "The Clinton Body Count: Coincidence or the Kiss of Death?" then contained the names of ', u' she believed had died suspiciously and who had ties to the Clinton family. Thompson admitted she had "no direct evidence" of Clinton\'s killing anyone. Indeed, she said the deaths were probably caused by "people trying to control the President" but refused to say who they were. Thompson said her allegations of murder "seem groundless only because the mainstream media haven\'t done enough digging." \r\n', u'\r\nAh, but they had. If not before she put her list together, at least afterwards.  Anyone who continues to state the mainstream media has given these claims short shrift is being disingenuous.\r\n', u'\r\nSince 1994, various respected news outlets have been confronted with versions of the "Clinton Body Count" list, run their own investigations of a few of the claims, and found nothing to substantiate what they looked into. Those investigations would culminate in yet another story about an oddball conspiracy rumor. \r\n', u'\r\nBut conspiracy theories don\'t die that easily. These "body count" lists and the many specious claims contained therein continue to circulate in cyberspace and beyond: yesterday\'s newspaper articles are forgotten with the next day\'s delivery, but ', u' lives forever.\r\n', u'\r\nA 2007 version of the "Clinton Body Count" list was headed with this entry:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nJames McDougal, a key witness for Whitewater prosecutors when the investigation centered on an Arkansas land deal in which the president and McDougal were involved, had a pre-existing heart condition and died of a heart attack on ', u' 1998 while in solitary confinement at the Federal Medical Center prison in Fort Worth. The ailing McDougal had been placed in solitary as punishment for failing to provide a urine sample for a drug test. On the day before his death and while still in his regular cell (where he had access to his heart medications), he had complained of dizziness, and while being processed for isolation he threw up. However, once in isolation, he did not ask for his medicines and appeared to guards "alert, well-oriented and absent any visible signs of distress" right up until his death. An investigation into the circumstances of his demise did not find evidence of foul play.\r\n', u'\r\n(The McDougal entry was not part of the "Clinton Body Count" list as it circulated in 1998.)\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nFormer White House intern Mary Caitrin ', u', 25, manager of a Georgetown Starbucks, was killed along with two ', u' (Emory Allen Evans, 25, and Aaron David Goodrich, 18) on ', u' 1997 during a robbery of the shop. In March 1999, Carl Derek Havord Cooper (29) of Washington was arrested and charged with these murders. \r\n', u"\r\nYes, it is unusual that three employees were killed in the course of a robbery during which nothing was taken.  According to Cooper's ", u' 2000 guilty plea (he received life with no hope of parole), he went to the Starbucks to rob the place, figuring the receipts from the ', u' weekend would make for a fat take. He came in after closing, waved a .38, and ordered all three Starbucks employees into the back room. Once there, Mahoney made a run for it after Cooper fired a warning shot into the ceiling. She was ordered back to the room, but then went for the gun. Cooper shot her, then afterwards shot the other two employees. He left empty-handed, afraid the shots had attracted police attention. As regrettable as these three deaths were, this was nothing but a case of a robbery gone wrong.\r\n', u'\r\nAnd, right away, we have come to the first big lie of the "Clinton Body Count" list: Any unexplained death can automatically be attributed to President Clinton by inventing a connection between him and the victim.  Mary Mahoney did once work as an intern at the White House, but so have hundreds of other people who are all still alive.  There is no credible reason why, of all the interns who have served in the Clinton White House, Mahoney alone would be the target of a Clinton-directed killing. (Contrary to public perception, very few interns work in the West Wing of the White House or have any contact with the President.  The closest most interns get to the chief executive is a single brief handshake or group photo.)\r\n', u"\r\nThe putative reason offered for Mahoney's slaying, that she was about to testify about sexual harrassment in the White House, was a lie.  This absurd justification apparently sprang from a hint dropped by Mike Isikoff of ", u' just before the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke that a "former White House staffer" with the initial "M" was about to talk about her affair with Clinton. We all know now, of course, that the "staffer" referred to was Monica Lewinsky, not Mary Mahoney.  The conspiracy buffs maintained that White House hit men rushed out, willy-nilly, and gunned down the first female ', u' they could find whose name began with "M." \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThis laundry list of deaths always refers to someone taking his life as "ruled a suicide," thus implying another conclusion of equal likelihood was capriciously dismissed by someone who had the power to do so. From here on, read "ruled a suicide" as "an investigation was carried out, arriving at this as the only reasonable conclusion."\r\n', u'\r\nWhite House deputy counsel Vince Foster committed suicide on the night of ', u' 1993 by shooting himself once in the head, a day after he contacted his doctor about his depression. A note in the form of a draft resignation letter was found in the bottom of his briefcase a week after his death. (Note that this letter was ', u', as is often claimed, a "suicide note"; it was Foster\'s outline for a letter of resignation.) Foster cited negative ', u" editorials about him, as well as the much-criticized role of the counsel's office in the controversial firing of seven White House travel office workers. \r\n", u"\r\nOn 10 October 1997, special prosecutor Kenneth Starr released his report on the investigation into Foster's death, the ", u" such investigation (after ones conducted by the coroner and Starr's predecessor, ", u' Fiske) of the matter. The ', u" summary of a three-year investigation concluded that Foster shot himself with the pistol discovered in his right hand. There was no sign of a struggle, nor any evidence he'd been drugged or intoxicated or that his body had been moved. \r\n", u'\r\nIf Foster had been murdered or if unanswered questions about his death remained, Starr would have been the last person to want to conclude the investigation prematurely. Or are we to believe Kenneth Starr is part of the ', u" too?  And if we buy into this conspiracy theory, what are we expected to believe?  That a group of professional killers capable of furtively carrying out dozens of murders all over the world shot Vince Foster, then clumsily dumped him in a park (after he had bled out), planted a gun he didn't own in his hand (without bothering to press his fingerprints onto it), amateurishly forged a suicide note (in several different handwritings), then expected the nation would believe his death was a suicide? \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nAll plane crashes are "suspicious," because airplanes are supposed to stay in the air, and when they don\'t it\'s because something went terribly wrong. Pilot error and mechanical failure are by far the most common causes underlying any crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigates every downed plane in the U.S., and though they might not always pin down the exact cause of a crash, they\'re generally pretty good about ruling out the use of explosives or mechanical tampering.  If the NTSB doesn\'t find evidence of tampering or explosives, then that\'s not what downed the plane, and we\'re left with pilot error and mechanical failure as our choices.\r\n', u'\r\nRaiser, his son, and three others died in a plane crash in Alaska on ', u' 1992 during a fishing trip. The pilot and another passenger survived and were hospitalized with severe burns. While the "body count" list claims "no cause determined," the NTSB ', u' otherwise: pilot error in a small plane flying in mountainous terrain during low visibility conditions led to the crash.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nPaul Tully died on ', u' 1992.  Problem is, there wasn\'t anything the least bit unusual about his death, so whoever cooked up this list had to lie and claim that "no cause was ever determined" and "no autopsy was allowed."  However, an autopsy ', u" performed, and Tully's cause of death ", u' determined: a massive heart attack.  (Not a surprising demise, given that Tully was extremely overweight, a heavy drinker, and a chain smoker.)  According to Steve Nawojczyk, the Pulaski County coroner, "An autopsy by the Arkansas medical examiner\'s office discovered advanced coronary artery disease."  He added that investigators found no evidence of external trauma to the body. \r\n', u'\r\nNote again that the conspiracy buffs offer no putative reason for Tully\'s "killing," yet would have us believe that Clinton ordered his chief strategist rubbed out while the most important election of his career was a little over a month away. \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nEd Willey was a former Virginia state senator and a lawyer; his wife Kathleen was active in Democratic state politics, worked as a volunteer (including some fund-raising efforts) on behalf of the Clinton campaign in Virginia in 1992, and later served as a volunteer in the White House Social Office.  Ed Willey's death was as clear cut a case of suicide as one is likely to find: he was a desperate, unstable man who (along with his wife) spent money lavishly, stole $275,000 of a client's money, and was about half a million dollars in debt to the IRS. He took his own life on ", u' 1993, leaving behind a suicide note found by his wife reading: "Saying I\'m sorry doesn\'t begin to explain. I hope one day you will forgive me." \r\n', u"\r\nAt the same time as Willey was killing himself, his wife was allegedly being groped by Bill Clinton. She said she'd gone to the Chief Executive looking for a job to help her family out of its financial crisis and found herself fending off his advances. Clinton admitted to the meeting but denied her version of what took place. Kathleen Willey testified in Paula Jones' sexual harrassment suit against Clinton, but she never claimed that Clinton had her husband killed.\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\n', u' Friday, an Arkansas lawyer who had been on the Clinton presidential campaign finance committee, died in a airplane accident on 1 March 1994. His plane did not "explode"; this accident was another case of ', u" that occurred when the 73-year-old Friday, at the plane's controls, crashed it during an attempted landing on a poorly-lighted private airfield at dusk on a dark and drizzly day. \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nOn 26 September 1993, Luther (Jerry) ', u' was hit with ten bullets from a ', u' semiautomatic handgun as he left a Mexican restaurant at the edge of Little Rock. His murder remains unsolved.\r\n', u"\r\nParks' security company guarded Clinton's campaign headquarters in 1992. Parks' son, Gary, asserted in ", u' and ', u' (both video products of Linda Thompson\'s American Justice Federation) that his father collected a secret file of Clinton\'s indiscretions, and that his father was using the file to try to blackmail the Clinton campaign.  (He also claimed that Vince Foster knew of the file\'s existence.)  Despite these allegations, the younger Parks never produced the mysterious file, and Clyde Steelman, a homicide sergeant with the Little Rock police force, dismissed Gary Parks\' theories of his father\'s death as "unsubstantiated, nothing to grasp." A far more likely suspect in the murder was Jerry Parks\' former partner, with whom Parks had quarreled bitterly.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nJohn Wilson was the chairman of the District of Columbia Council, and his suicide was far from "very suspicious": Wilson had a long history of depression, was wrestling with marital problems, and had tried to kill himself on at least four other occasions.  He finally succeeded on  ', u' 1993. Upon his death, Wilson\'s wife said, "[His] depression was an inherited problem; that he was able to contribute so much over the years in the face of his disability was a miracle." Police said that he did not leave a note and that there were no signs of foul play.\r\n', u'\r\nWilson had absolutely nothing in common with Clinton other than that they worked in the same city (i.e., Washington, D.C.). The claim that Wilson had ', u' to do with the ', u' real estate controversy is laughable. \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nKathy Ferguson killed herself with a gunshot to the right temple on ', u' 1994 at the home of her boyfriend, Bill Shelton.  Their relationship had fallen on hard times, with each accusing the other of having been unfaithful. Ferguson left behind a suicide note that read: "I can\'t stay here any longer. Things will never be the same for us. I can\'t take that." Close by was another note from Shelton questioning her relationship with another man, which Ferguson\'s daughter said her mother had been upset over.\r\n', u"\r\nWe found no mention of packed suitcases in any of the reports about Ferguson's death, but even if there were, it wouldn't be the least bit surprising.  Is it so unusual that a woman might be thinking of moving out of the house of a boyfriend who had quarreled with her and challenged her fidelity?\r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nShelton killed himself over Kathy Ferguson's grave on ", u' 1994, leaving a suicide note that was found beside his body. Just a month earlier he had quarreled with his girlfriend, accused her of cheating on him, and driven her to suicide. There was nothing mysterious about his death or his reasons for taking his life.  And if the idea that the ', u' of an Arkansas state trooper constitutes a Clinton "connection" weren\'t absurd enough, we\'re now offered the boyfriend of an ', u' of an Arkansas state trooper.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nNews accounts stated that Gandy Baugh died "at home" on ', u' 1994 without specifying the causes.  "Died at home" is a euphemism often employed in news articles and obituaries to avoid a direct mention of suicide, but we haven\'t found any definitive information about how Baugh died.\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nOn 3 March 1994, the Cessna plane carrying a pilot, dentist, Donald Rogers, and two other passengers crashed. The pilot had earlier radioed in that he was experiencing electrical trouble and then lost radio contact. The NTSB's ", u' of the crash found nothing "mysterious" about it: the plane\'s left generator had severely overheated and shut down, leaving the plane without electrical systems; the plane went down far off its planned route, and the pilot was good and lost at the time of the crash.  \r\n', u'\r\nNo amount of digging has disclosed why a dentist would have such revelatory information about the President of the United States that a plane crash would be arranged to bump him off.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nHow anyone can confuse dying of pneumonia with suicide is beyond us. Huggins died on ', u' 1994, and according ', u" Callery, Delaware's top medical examiner, viral myocarditis and bronchial pneumonia killed Huggins. ", u' Ivory of the University of Delaware police said his exhaustive investigation of Huggins\'s death turned up "no sign at all of foul play." \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nOn 23 October 1994, 69-year-old Florence Martin of Mabelle, Texas ', u" from Wichita Falls), was murdered in her home by three gunshots to the head through a pillow. She wasn't an accountant for the CIA, though: She worked the graveyard shift at a convenience store in nearby Seymour and had lived in that area for decades. \r\n", u"\r\nIn 2012, Jack Wesley Melton was charged with Martin's murder. DNA found at the scene was matched to him, leading to his arrest.\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nAt the time of ', u" Coleman's suicide, Bill Clinton was her law professor. In 1992 an overzealous supporter of George Bush hired investigators to probe this girl's 1977 suicide, and they found no evidence that the two had an affair. It was an old rumor and a baseless one, and even a determined attempt at muckraking turned up nothing to substantiate it.\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nThe accident that killed Paula ', u' took place during the afternoon of ', u' 1992. Her car overturned at a curve in the highway, throwing her ', u' from the vehicle. No one witnessed the accident.  And no one provided any explanation for what secrets about Clinton an interpreter might possess that would merit her murder.\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nWilcher's partially decomposed body was found seated on the toilet in his Washington, D.C., home on ", u' 1993, and his death was attributed to natural causes. According to the ', u' Wilcher "was investigating the theory of an \'October Surprise\' conspiracy during the 1980 federal election campaign. He had been interviewing an inmate who claimed to have piloted George Bush to Paris so he could secretly seek to delay the release of ', u' hostages in Iran."  President Clinton, just a year into his first term, would hardly be likely to give up a key political advantage by bumping off someone who was supposedly about to dig up some major dirt on the Republican party\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nWe have found no information about this man, not a report of his death nor of his being an Resolution Trust Corporation investigator. Various versions of this list state that his death took place on ', u" 1993 at the Lincoln Towers in Arlington, Virginia, but we've found no documentation of that.\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nWhat "new evidence"? Ron Brown and ', u' were killed in a plane crash in Croatia on ', u' 1996. The plane slammed into a mountain while on landing approach. There were no survivors. \r\n', u"\r\nA lot has been made of an x-ray of Brown's skull showing what looks like a round entry wound. \r\n", u"\r\nCloser examination of Brown's skull by military officials revealed no bullet, no bone fragments, no metal fragments and, even more telling, no exit wound.  \r\n", u'\r\nSimply imagining a scenario under which Ron Brown could have been shot takes one into the realm of the absurd.  Was he shot in the head ', u' the flight, in full view of thirty-four other witnesses?  (If so, how did the shooters get off the plane?)  Did the killers shoot him ', u' the flight, then bundle his body into a seat (just like ', u') and hope nobody noticed the gaping hole in his head?  Or did Croatian commandos fortuitously appear on the scene to scale a mountain and pump a bullet into the head of an already-dead plane crash victim?\r\n', u'\r\nAn exhaustive Air Force ', u' of the crash found that pilot error was to blame:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nThere was no pool of blood, and Barbara Wise's death was never ruled a suicide by anyone. She was discovered in her Commerce Department office on ", u' 1996 after having last been seen alive on ', u' 1996, the day before Thanksgiving. A thorough investigation uncovered no evidence of foul play or suicide. Wise had a history of frequent and severe health problems, including liver ailments, and her death was attributed to natural causes. \r\n\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nCharles Meissner died in the same plane crash that took the life of Ron Brown, the one in Croatia on ', u' 1996. Fourteen ', u' Department staffers died in that crash, Meissner and Brown among them.\r\n', u"\r\nWe're now entering an long segment of the list wherein a number of deaths are tied to those of Don Henry and Kevin Ives, who were supposedly linked to Bill Clinton.  All of this linkage is one big canard: Henry and Ives had nothing to do with Clinton; they were two young men who foolishly ripped off drugs from a dealer and were beaten to death in revenge.   With no link between Clinton and Henry or Ives, the following eight entries collapse like a house of cards.\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nHenry and Ives were run over by a train on ', u' 1987. ', u" Malak, Arkansas' former state medical examiner, ruled the deaths accidental, saying the teens fell asleep on the tracks after smoking marijuana. A 1988 Saline County grand jury determined the boys were murdered and their bodies afterwards laid on the tracks, but no other conclusions were reached and no indictments were returned. \r\n", u"\r\nA number of Malak's determinations had been challenged and overturned during his career. He certainly wasn't always a conscientious medical examiner, and his Ives and Henry rulings were only two of many such he botched.\r\n", u'\r\nGetting back to the real meat of who killed the boys, we find nothing that ties Ives and Henry to Clinton. Though various of these lists will claim the boys accidentally stumbled onto a "protected" drug drop and were killed for it, there\'s no reason to believe even that. In a ', u' 1990 hearing before U.S. Magistrate Henry ', u" Katherine Brightop said her ex-boyfriend Paul William Criswell told her he and three other men were involved in the teenagers' deaths. Brightop said Criswell told her the boys tried to steal cocaine from Callaway's home and they were caught and beaten to death before their bodies were placed on the tracks. \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\n19-year-old Keith ', u' died on ', u" 1988 when the motorcycle he was driving struck the back of a tractor-trailer. He was riding a motorcycle he'd stolen the day before. There were no reports of a high-speed car chase.\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nIn August 1989, Ronald Shane Smith was sentenced to ten years for the ', u' 1988 murder of Keith McKaskle. McKaskle had earlier expressed fears for his life, linking them to his knowing something about "the railroad track thing". Smith may have been paid to kill McKaskle, as a prison inmate said he had been approached and offered $4,000 to kill McKaskle himself.\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nGreg Collins (25) of Bryant, Arkansas, was found shot in woods near Rosston on ', u" 1989.  If he truly knew something about drug-related murders, that's reason enough for him to have been killed without any connection to Bill Clinton.\r\n", u'\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nIn July 1989 Frank Pilcher was arrested for the April 1989 murder of Jeffrey Rhodes. Rhodes had earlier told his father he feared for his life because he'd witnessed a narcotics transaction.\r\n", u'\r\nRhodes was last seen alive on ', u' His body was discovered in a dumpster on ', u" He'd been shot twice in the head and his body was badly burned. The body was likely burned in an effort to destroy forensic evidence that would led investigators to the murderer.\r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nThis is my favorite entry. Remember that Arkansas medical examiner, the one I said wasn't always the most conscientious investigator on God's green earth? Yep, we're about to see him again. Fahmy Malak listed James Milam's cause of death as a perforated ulcer, adding that Milam's small dog afterwards ate the dead man's head, accounting for Milam's headless condition.\r\n", u"\r\nMilam's daughter-in-law insists Milam was murdered. She claims Malak showed her photographs of the headless corpse, and the neck was cut clean. The Milam family has not attempted to legally challenge the ruling because of the expense, so we'll never know which way the cat jumps, ulcer or murder.\r\n", u'\r\nWhatever killed him, Milam died three months ', u' the Ives and Henry murders.

Without seeing them, I'm not confident in stating an opinion on whether or not those attempts took place.\r\n", u'\r\nPatrick was a client of Lasater, albeit a reluctant one. He was asked to open an account there, he refused, one was opened for him anyway, and he was handed "profits" from one transaction for his part in allowing whatever was going on to take place. Again, someone who got involved with drug dealers ended up in trouble. In this case, an otherwise upstanding man took money he knew to be dirty to keep quiet about what his account was being used for. If he\'s now being chased by drug dealers who don\'t want the details of the transactions to come to light, is that all that surprising?\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nDavis said he had awakened in his hotel room with a big bump on his head.

"I certainly wasn\'t about to conclude that somebody cracked me on the head," Davis said at the time. \r\n', u'\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nIn 1988 Larry Nichols, then a marketing director for the Arkansas Development Finance Authority, was fired from his job for making hundreds of calls to the Nicaraguan contras from his office. In 1990 he filed a lawsuit against Clinton claiming the then-Governor of Arkansas and others made him the scapegoat in a misappropriation-of-funds charge that cost him his job. In that suit he also tossed in claims of extramarital affairs, naming five women Clinton was supposed to have chased across the sheets. Nichols withdrew his lawsuit in 1992 and issued a round of apologies to everyone involved. He admitted what he'd said had been an attempt to destroy the Governor by innuendo.\r\n", u'\r\nNichols has since changed his tune yet again, and has returned to making allegations against Clinton, always being careful to stop just short of asserting Clinton is involved in various murders and other crimes Nichols points to as "suspicious." \r\n', u'\r\nSince his dismissal from the AFDA, Nichols has made a career of peddling anti-Clinton books and tapes to the lunatic fringe. Take anything claimed about or by this man with a huge grain of salt.\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe bottom line on this piece of ', u" It's a badly worked laundry list dressed up to appear significant. The promised damning connections to the Chief Executive are missing, with innuendo misinformation offered up in their place. Nothing ties Clinton to any of these deaths, something this list (and others of its ilk) conveniently glosses over. What evidence is offered that would compel a rational person to believe there was Clinton involvement in any of these deaths?\r\n", u"\r\nClinton was acquainted with some people who died \u2014 that's about all one can make of this list. Indeed, that's far more than can be made of a number of the entries, specifically, that of Ives and Henry and all those supposedly tied to theirs.\r\n", u"\r\nThough it's clear from digging through numerous newspaper articles there is a thriving and dangerous drug culture in Little Rock, how or why this should be connected to Bill Clinton is left unanswered. Regrettably, Little Rock is akin to numerous other large cities: it has its share of drug dealers, murders, and violence. It also has one very famous citizen. And that's about as much of a connection as anyone can make.\r\n", u'\r\nWhereas a typical private citizen has a much smaller circle of acquaintance, those in public office come into contact with a great many people over the course of their careers. It is therefore not unusual to find at least a few accidental deaths, homicides, and suicides among any politician\'s list of contacts. (For example, a "body count" list exists for ', u'.)\r\n', u"\r\nA number of suicides are enumerated in this list.  Suicide is far from an unusual mode of demise.  It claims 32,000 lives in the U.S. every year, and it's the 9th leading cause of death. It is indeed a rare person who does not know ", u' who died by his own hand.\r\n', u'\r\nDeaths by airplane crash account for a number of entries on the list. Again, this is not all that surprising. Every year many small planes crash in the United States, and some of those crashes result in fatalities. As mentioned above, the National Transportation Safety Board investigates every one of them, to determine both the cause of the accident as well as to gather data that will help prevent future tragedies. The agency does a thorough job of looking into the circumstances surrounding each downed plane. To describe any of the plane crash deaths on this list as "suspicious" is to suggest the NTSB was part of a coverup.\r\n', u"\r\nThere have been a couple of unsolved murders (Jerry Parks, Kevin Ives, and Don Henry), but there have also been deaths by natural causes that have been tossed into the mix willy-nilly simply to boost the body count. (Like I said earlier, how can anyone claim a death by pneumonia was a suicide?) All the best lies make sure to mix a bit of truth in with them, and the few genuinely unsolved murders work to cloak the many less credible claims in an aura of plausibility. Don't be overly bemused by them ", u' each entry on its own merits.\r\n', u"\r\nOne final question to ask yourself before falling for any Clinton Body Count list: If the Chief Executive was having people bumped off left, right, and center, why aren't Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp on this list? At the time of Mary Mahoney's death \u2014 a death this list hints was ordered by Clinton \u2014 neither Tripp nor Lewinsky were the high-profile household names they now are; they were complete unknowns. It would be another six months before information about them would explode into the news. If the President were in the habit of having those dangerous to his presidency put in the ground, why didn't he order these deaths?\r\n", u'\r\nBarbara "let\'s get back to Clinton\'s bawdy count, okay?"

Certainly many Americans viewed them as representing the very worst of that era\'s political movements: a group of hate-filled militant thugs who felt their disaffection with the existing social and political systems justified anything required to achieve their aim of "revolution by any means necessary" (such as smuggling guns into a Marin County courtroom in an attempt to free Panther George Jackson, resulting in a shoot-out that killed a judge, two \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ninmates, and Jackson\'s brother).  Others at the time, however, believed the Panthers were the only political group that truly represented a downtrodden and marginalized group of people who had been enslaved, discriminated against, and denied civil rights protections for hundreds of years; that sought to improve the condition of the poor by operating schools, opening medical clinics, and providing free breakfasts for ghetto children; and that had the courage to stand up to the brutality visited upon them by law enforcement acting in the service of a government and a society that sought to "keep them in their place."\r\n', u'\r\nIn May of 1969, Black Panther founder and national chairman Bobby Seale (who had already been indicted for his alleged participation in demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 1968) made a trip from Oakland to ', u' Connecticut, to speak at Yale University.  The Black Panthers were by then nationally known, a focus of media attention, and under the active surveillance of the FBI. ', u' Hoover had publicly declared several months earlier that he considered the Panthers "the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.") Rumors of police informants and government spies having infiltrated the party were rampant, and a man named Alex Rackley, a member of the Panthers\' New York chapter, fell under suspicion.  Rackley was taken to the home of Warren Kimbro (described as a "community organizer and aspiring Panther") where he was held captive for ', u" beaten, and scalded with boiling water in an effort to force him to confess.  Rackley was then taken to a marsh in Middlefield by Kimbro, George Sams (a Panther field marshal and, according to some, himself a police informant), and Lonnie McLucas (a Panther member from Bridgeport), where Sams ordered Kimbro and McLucas to kill the suspected informant.  (Who did the actual killing has always been disputed: McLucas reportedly fired the first shot, but Kimbro admitted to delivering the bullet to the head that killed Rackley.)  Rackley's body was discovered the next day by fishermen, and fourteen Black Panthers were arrested and charged with murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy, and nine of them were indicted.\r\n", u'\r\nThe subsequent murder trials of Black Panthers that took place in New Haven beginning in 1970 was a cause c\xe9l\xe8bre, the latest "trial of the century" that pitted the "establishment" against the "radicals": the former supposedly valiantly defending the values of mainstream American society, while the latter were supposedly being framed and railroaded by government powers determined to destroy them at any cost.  Upwards of 12,000 Black Panther supporters made their way to New Haven, and many of them were housed and fed in and around the campus of Yale University.  Classes at Yale were made optional for the last few months of the term as Panther supporters swarmed the campus in protest and the president of Yale University, Kingman ', u' announced: "I personally want to say that I\'m appalled and ashamed that things should have come to such a pass that I am skeptical of the ability of Black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the U.S."\r\n', u'\r\nFrom that maelstrom came the 1999 political piece reproduced above, which claims that two 1990\'s political figures, Hillary Clinton (then First Lady) and Bill Lann Lee (former acting head of the Justice Department\'s civil rights division whose appointment by President Bill Clinton was controversial because of Lee\'s support for affirmative action programs),  defended the Black Panthers, helped "shut down" Yale University, and aided the accused Panthers in going free or serving lenient sentences.  But all of that is gross exaggeration: neither Clinton nor Lee did any of those things, and any involvement they had with the New Haven Black Panther trials was extremely minor and tangential.\r\n', u'\r\nWe\'ll begin with the last part, the claim that "These two people actually went so far as to shut down Yale University with demonstrations in defense of the accused Black Panthers during their trial."  This statement is ridiculously far-fetched: Yale University went to a "voluntarily optional" class schedule (it did not "shut down") for a few months at the end of the term in mid-1970 because thousands of Black Panther protesters had flooded the campus and its environs, not because of anything Hillary Clinton or Bill Lee did. And while the Panthers made have found many sympathetic supporters among the student body at Yale, neither Hillary Clinton or Bill Lee led or participated in  student demonstrations in support of the Black Panthers, or spoke up in their defense.\r\n', u'\r\nThe above-quoted article also asks "How in the world do you think that these killers got off so easy?  Well, maybe it was in some part due to the efforts of two people who came to the defense of the Panthers."  But neither Bill Lee nor Hillary Clinton "defended" the Panthers, either in a public or a legal sense.  Bill Lee wasn\'t a lawyer, or even a law student; he was simply another Yale undergraduate who had no involvement in the Black Panthers\' trial. Hillary Rodham (as she was known then) wasn\'t a lawyer then, either: She was a Yale law student, and like many of her politically-minded fellow law students who saw the latest "trial of the century" taking place just outside the main gate of their school, she took advantage of an opportunity to be involved in the case in a minor, peripheral way by organizing other students to help the American Civil Liberties Union monitor the trials for civil rights violations.  Her tangential participation in the trial in no way helped "free" Black Panthers tried for the murder of Alex Rackley\r\n', u'\r\nIn fact, the killers of Alex Rackley didn\'t "go free": Lonnie McLucas was was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison,  and Warren Kimbro and George Sams turned state\'s evidence and pleaded guilty to second degree murder, serving four years in prison. Bobby Seale and Ericka Huggins (who were accused not of killing Rackley, but of being present during his captivity and boiling water to torture him with) went free not due to any efforts on the part of Hillary Clinton or Bill Lee, but because the state failed to sufficiently prove its case against them: the jury deadlocked in favor of acquittal for both defendants, and the trial judge dismissed the charges against both of them.  And, of course, neither Hillary Clinton nor Bill Lee had anything to do with the post-trial lives of Seale and Huggins.\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 1 January 2014\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

Security measures of this level are not specific to the Clintons; the homes of all Presidents are treated this way, as (to a lesser extent) are the homes of former presidents. (In 1981, for example, the Secret Service spent several months providing round-the-clock protection, at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars per day, for an ', u' Pacific Palisades, California, home owned by Ronald and Nancy Reagan, even though the Reagans no longer lived in or used the house, and even though it was vacant and up for sale.) \r\n', u"\r\nThe costs of installation and maintenance for security systems at the properties of current and former presidents comes from public funds, because the protection of first families is viewed as a right and proper charge upon the nation.

According to a prevalent whisper, the land's new First Lady had pitched a lamp at her husband during a fight in the White House. Just barely moved in, the Clintons had supposedly gone at it like cats and dogs. Some said the argument erupted over the President's ogling one of the celebrities at a ", u" show. Others asserted the fight kicked off over whether Hillary's offices would be located in the \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\ncritical West Wing or elsewhere in the White House.  Frequently, the story included a subplot about antagonism between Hillary and her Secret Service guards, who had supposedly leaked the tale.\r\n', u'\r\nThe story moved across the city and blanketed the country in short order. Unlike other gossip about the new residents of ', u" Avenue, this tidbit endured, eclipsing even the ongoing rumors about Bill's attraction to and possible affairs with women in Washington. (Stories about Bill's interest in gals other than his wife would pop up at various times throughout his two terms, but it was not until his second term that any of them was accorded much weight. During that first term these rumors generally died on the vine, which is surprising given how many different rumored liaisons there were.)\r\n", u'\r\nThe rumor about the lamp moved into the print media on ', u' 1993 when the ', u' reported:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nNotice that in this early incarnation, Hillary merely broke a lamp during an argument with Bill; she didn't launch it at him.

By March, it had found its way into a number of major publications, and by summer it had achieved the status of topic joking references were made to on late-night television. Yet even before it was disseminated by these major pop culture outlets, a great number of folks outside the political community had come to hear it.

By March 1993, the first print mutation appeared in the ', u', transforming the lamp into a book, possibly even a Bible (a pointed touch, given the widespread rumors about Bill Clinton\'s sexual infidelities), and noting that "Tale-tellers say blood was drawn." (The "book" version was already circulating orally and had been briefly mentioned in a ', u' 1993 ', u' segment.) ', u' soon after ran an account that described the First Lady as throwing "a lamp, a briefing book or a Bible" at the President, adding the further detail that Hillary then lit up a cigarette to punish her smoke-allergic husband. Another version given in the ', u' around the same time mutated the whisper even more, stating the rumor as "[T]he Clintons variously throwing books, lamps and punches at each other." (This change altered the story from an angered wife flinging an item at her husband to a marital brouhaha involving both parties pitching things and coming to blows.)\r\n', u'\r\nThe ', u' added they had heard from a Washington reporter that Hillary had thrown an urn, not a lamp, and a drawing accompanying the ', u"'s article about the rumor showed the First Lady standing on Bill's Oval Office desk and aiming a lamp at his head while a broken urn sat on the floor. When Hillary Clinton hosted a ", u' televised tour of the White House with interviewer Katie Couric, the latter kiddingly requested that Hillary point out where she\'d been standing when she threw a lamp at Bill. The First Lady deftly responded, "Well, you know, I\'m looking for that spot, too."\r\n', u'\r\nThe ', u" concluded the thrown-lamp rumor began on Inauguration Day, with Senate Republicans waiting in a room next to the Clintons overhearing a fight between the couple that included Hillary's shouting at Bill and threatening to throw something at him. Additionally, the ", u' reported a Secret Service agent claimed Hillary had pitched a Bible at ', u' for driving too slowly. \r\n', u'\r\nAlmost as interesting as the rumor itself is an examination of why this particular tale resonated with the general population to the extent it did.

Moreover, as the ', u"'s Emily Heil noted in her summary of ", u"'s account of Bill's alleged book-beaning:\r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nCould the lamp rumor have been a deliberate attempt by political opponents to undermine the First Lady by fabricating a yarn that invoked the very bogey(wo)man whom the nation feared was lurking behind the mask? Or were others taken in by a piece of gossip laying responsibility for this whisper at the feet of the Republicans? And could there have been something to the story, at least an overheard verbal argument between the Clintons during which mention was made of throwing something?\r\n', u'\r\nBarring shards of a lamp being unearthed, no one will ever really know.

This "everything that is marriage but the name" decision pleased some and angered others, resulting in many heated opinions about same-sex unions in specific, and homosexuality in general, to be bruited in countless public forums. \r\n', u'\r\nThanks to her oft-aired opinion that homosexuals were a "mistake of nature," radio\'s ', u' Schlessinger became one of the targets of those of pro-gay sympathies looking for someone to shake a finger at.\r\n', u'\r\nDr. Schlessinger has attracted both adherents and detractors during her years of public life. Through her radio show, she dispenses advice to callers, usually from a conservative point of view. She was an Orthodox Jew at the time the letter quoted above was written (but she announced her renunciation of that faith on her show in July 2003) and often draws upon the Bible or religious teachings for guidance. She is blunt and forthright in her replies, viewing most situations as inherently black or white, right or \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nwrong.\r\n', u'\r\nLaura Schlessinger is neither a medical doctor nor accredited in a discipline one would traditionally look to for the generation of expertise in moral, societal, or spiritual matters (such as divinity, psychology, or sociology). She earned her doctorate in physiology from Columbia University and practiced as a licensed marriage, family, and child counselor for more than a decade (although her California Marriage Family and Child Counseling license has been inactive for several years).\r\n', u' \r\nIn 1998 nude photos of Laura Schlessinger were displayed on the Internet. During the commotion over those pictures, their source was revealed  to be veteran ', u" radio broadcaster Bill Ballance, a man who was pivotal in getting Schlessinger her start in radio. Ballance claimed he photographed her in 1978, while the pair of them were having an affair during Schlessinger's first marriage.\r\n", u'\r\nSome see Schlessinger\'s use of "Doctor" as misleading and view her current stance on the sanctity of marriage and the wrongness of adultery as hypocrisy in light of her decades-earlier affair. Others believe the title of "Doctor" should not be restricted only to those in the medical field and hold that people can change over time, even to the point of full repudiation of previous behaviors and beliefs. (Our article about the origin of the hymn ', u' showcases one such spiritual about-face.)\r\n', u"\r\nDr. Laura is as controversial as she is popular, so she attracts both bouquets and brickbats whenever topics she is known to harbor strong opinions about become part of the day's news.

Simply put, the letter points out a logical flaw in the "homosexuality is wrong because the Bible says so" argument: if homosexuality is wrong because it goes against God\'s law as outlined in the Bible, why aren\'t any number of activities now viewed as innocuous but once regarded as unacceptable also offenses against God\'s law?

Note that you need to learn this system by trial and error: Because gas gauge needles do not necessarily move at an even rate across the full range between ', u" you can't assume that a car with a ", u' gas tank will necessarily take exactly seven gallons to fill when the needle sits on the halfway mark.)\r\n', u"\r\nIt's much easier to determine whether pumps are accurately registering the proper charge for the amount of gasoline dispensed simply by multiplying the number of gallons you buy by the price per gallon.

(Venezuela is the fourth-largest supplier of crude oil to the U.S., sending the states about ', u' barrels daily.)  Ch\xe1vez also denounced President ', u' Bush as "the devil" in a ', u' speech before the ', u' Assembly and called Bush an "alcoholic" during a visit to Harlem the following day.\r\n', u"\r\nU.S. attitudes towards President Ch\xe1vez in early 2006 tended to be polarized along political lines, with one side declaring him a dangerous dictator who supported America's enemies, while the other side defended him as a democratically-elected leader who was the target of the Bush administration's enmity primarily because he dared to stand up to the U.S.  Excerpts from two U.S. newspaper ", u' pieces of that period illustrated this dichotomy:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nNeither a "buycott" nor a boycott was likely to accomplish much beyond the symbolic.  In the first case, the Citgo brand (marketed by ', u' Petroleum Corporation, which has been owned by Petr\xf3leos de Venezuela, \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nthe national oil company of Venezuela, since 1990) doesn't have nearly the capacity and presence in the U.S. to satisfy demand and wean American consumers from Middle Eastern oil supplies; in the second case, boycotting a gasoline brand over political issues is problematic for a number of reasons (not least of which is the notion that threatening not to buy gasoline from someone who is threatening not to sell it to you doesn't sound like an effective ploy for either side).  \r\n", u"\r\nMany different oil companies buy crude oil from Venezuela, so even Americans who shun CITGO brand gasoline have no guarantee that they aren't still sending their money to that country.  And although Citgo may be owned by Petr\xf3leos de Venezuela, it is a formerly American company which is still headquartered in the U.S. (in Houston, Texas), employs 4,000 people, and supplies 14,000 independent retailers with gasoline and other petroleum ", u' with no substantive connection to Venezuela who would be economically harmed by such an action. (Citgo also provides free or discounted heating oil to low-income communities and tribal reservations within the United States.) And, of course, in a tight oil market Citgo could likely find alternative buyers for its products far more easily than the U.S. could make up the shortfall created by a ', u' of Venezuelan oil.  \r\n', u"\r\nAs we've noted in many other ", u" discussing various schemes regarding where and how people should purchase gasoline, the global and fungible nature of the world oil market doesn't really provide consumers with many effective opportunities to influence political issues through their buying patterns. \r\n", u'\r\nSince the original e-petitions cited above originally appeared in early 2006, they have gone through a number of changes that added and dropped additional claims about Citgo.  In September 2006, the following addendum to one of the Citgo-related ', u' began circulating: \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, ', u' Inc. announced it was dropping Citgo Petroleum as its gasoline supplier, although the convenience store chain also stated the move was not motivated by political issues: ', u' contract with Citgo was due to expire at the end of September 2006, and the company had already made plans to market its own brand of gasoline.\r\n', u'\r\nIn October 2006, the following e-mail about Citgo and Petro Express began circulating:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nBoth ', u' and ', u' \r\nare privately-owned chains of convenience stores, the former an international property of Quebec-based Alimentation Couche-Tard, and the latter owned by ', u' which is headquartered in Sanford, North Carolina.  Neither chain is owned by Citgo or the Venezuela government.  \r\n', u'\r\nPetro Express outlets (which the parent company has been converting to their Kangaroo Express brand) were known for selling Citgo-branded gasoline.  ', u' stated in ', u" that the chain would be phasing out sales of that brand by 2007, and  soon after The Pantry's ", u" of Petro Express in 2007,  the new parent company announced that gasoline sales at those outlets would be converted to Chevron's Texaco brand.  However, ", u' 2010 annual report indicates that Citgo is still one of their fuel suppliers, with a contract running through August 2013:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for independent stations and chains to switch fuel suppliers from time to time.  Occurrences of independents\' dropping Citgo in favor of other suppliers are often misinterpreted by the public as attempts on Citgo\'s part to "switch names" in order to fool consumers into continuing to purchase Citgo gasoline.\r\n', u'\r\nAn addendum about AK-47 factories and Iranian-run oil refineries was also later appended to this piece:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nAccording to news reports, Russia's Izhevsk Mechanical Plant (IMP) has already manufactured and supplied about 100,000 ", u' assault rifles to Venezuela under an earlier contract, and they have also signed a contract for two arms plants in Venezuela (one to produce ', u'  and the other to produce ', u' ammunition for those rifles), with construction to begin at the end of 2007 and be completed by 2010.\r\n', u'\r\nAlso in 2007, Venezuela and Iran signed a ', u' deal to develop ', u' a block of the lucrative Orinoco Reserve in Venezuela which is believed to hold more than ', u' barrels of oil.

Many pundits were quick to point out an incident that was much discussed during Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign, one touted as calling Huckabee's own parenting skills into question.\r\n", u'\r\nOn 11 July 1998, two young men working as counselors at Camp Pioneer in Hatfield, Arkansas, killed a dog at that Boy Scout camp. One of those young men was 19-year-old Clayton Frady of Texarkana and the other David Huckabee, the youngest son of Arkansas Governor Michael Dale "Mike" Huckabee. David Huckabee was 17 at the time of the slaying, although he would turn 18 less than two weeks later. Both young men were fired over the \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nincident.\r\n', u'\r\nAnd that is where the undisputed facts of the story leave off. All the rest of the details, including why the dog was killed, how the dog was killed, and whether Governor Huckabee attempted (successfully or otherwise) to forestall investigations into his son\'s act, is up for grabs and may never be knowable.  (Thus we can only verify the basic fact that David Huckabee killed a dog at a Boy Scout camp, not he ancillary issue of whether he truly did so "brutally" or "for fun.")\r\n', u'\r\nWhile the dog itself was consistently described as a stray that had wandered onto the property, the only additional description of it came from Marcal Young, scout executive of the Caddo Area Council that operated the camp where the animal was killed, who said the canine was "probably a mixed breed." \r\n', u'\r\nAs to why the dog was killed, different people have offered different reasons. Governor Huckabee said in 2007 interview conducted by Larry King that "It was mangy. It looked like it was going to attack." The father of the other young man fired over the dog\'s slaying said in a 1998 news article his son had come upon one or more Scouts who had the dog "hung over a limb and choking," so his son helped "put it out of its misery." Scout executive Young said in another 1998 news article the two young men had told him the dog appeared to be ill.\r\n', u"\r\nNo one connected to any of the principals apparently wanted to talk about how the dog was dispatched.  The only person in that group who said anything about this was Danny Frady, father of Clayton Frady (the other young counselor fired over the incident), and even he didn't say what his son did; he only averred that when his son came upon the animal, it was being hanged by others.  Anonymous rumors about how the dog was killed claim Frady and Huckabee hanged the dog, slit its throat, and stoned it to death. \r\n", u'\r\nBut why would the young men have been fired if what they had done was merely to put a suffering animal out of its misery or strike down a sickly animal that looked like it was about to attack someone? Scout executive Young, the person who dismissed them from their jobs, said the pair were fired because they had violated a Scout law: "A Scout is kind." \r\n', u'\r\nA December 2007 ', u" article reported shortly after the animal's death, the local prosecuting attorney wrote a letter to the Arkansas state police asking them to investigate the case to see if the two young men involved had violated state animal cruelty laws. The state police did not look into the matter, and no charges were filed. \r\n", u"\r\nJohn Bailey, then director of Arkansas's state police, told ", u" personnel in Governor Huckabee's employ (his chief of staff and personal lawyer) leaned on him to write a letter officially denying the local prosecutor's request for an investigation. Wrote ", u': "Bailey, a career officer who had been appointed chief by Huckabee\'s Democratic predecessor, said he viewed the lawyer\'s intervention as improper and terminated the conversation." Bailey was fired by Huckabee seven months later, with (according to Bailey) one of the reasons given by Huckabee being that "I couldn\'t get you to help me with my son when I had that problem." ', u' quoted ', u' the former FBI chief in Little Rock, as saying "Without question, [Huckabee] was making a conscious attempt to keep the state police from investigating his son." \r\n', u'\r\nGovernor Huckabee denied using his influence to keep police out of the matter, saying to Larry King: "Well, let me categorically say that is absolutely not true. I never used my influence. In fact, if anything, I said treat it like you would anything else. I don\'t want special treatment for him or against him. My son was a minor at the time.

Candidates tout their accomplishments in balancing budgets or reducing government debt as examples of fiscal prudence while pointing to increased debts during their opponents' administrations as indicators of profligate and wasteful spending of taxpayers' money.  The chart reproduced above, which was posted to the ", u' of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, attempts to reverse conventional political stereotypes by portraying recent Republican presidents as \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nresponsible for huge increases in the national debt, while showing recent Democratic presidents as responsible for much lower increases in the level of debt.  (The chart shown above is a ', u" version of one prepared two weeks earlier, so we'll work the numbers from the more recent version.)\r\n", u'\r\nAs a first step in evaluating this chart, we have to determine the applicable definition of "debt."  In general, the term "public debt" (or "debt held by the public") refers to money borrowed by the government through the issuance and sale of securities, government bonds, and bills.  It includes federal debt held by all investors outside of the federal government, including individuals, corporations, state or local governments, the Federal Reserve banking system, and foreign governments. Another form of debt is "intragovernmental debt" (or "debt held by government accounts"), which refers to money that the government has borrowed from itself, such as when the U.S. government invests money from federal savings programs such as Medicare and the Social Security trust fund by buying up its own treasury securities.  A variety of names have been applied to the total of these two forms of debt, including "gross federal debt," "total public debt," and "national debt."\r\n', u' \r\nAlthough this chart is labeled as presenting a "percent increase in public debt," it actually uses figures corresponding to the total described as "gross federal debt" above (i.e., a combination of debt held by the public and debt held by government accounts, rather than just the former).  We checked the numbers in this chart by using (for pre-1993 years) the U.S. Treasury\'s ', u' (MSPD), noting the total debt reported as of ', u" of each relevant year, and (for 1993 onwards) the Treasury's ", u' application, noting the total debt reported as of Inauguration Day of each relevant year.\r\n', u'\r\nFrom these records, we gleaned the following information:\r\n', u'\r\nRonald Reagan: ', u'\r\nTook office January 1981.  Total debt: $848 billion ', u'\r\nLeft office January 1989.    Total debt: $2,698 billion ', u'\r\nPercent change in total debt:  +218% \r\n', u'\r\nGeorge H.W. Bush: ', u'\r\nTook office January 1989.  Total debt: $2,698 billion ', u'\r\nLeft office 20 January 1993.    Total debt: $4,188 billion ', u'\r\nPercent change in total debt:  +55%\r\n', u'\r\nBill Clinton: ', u'\r\nTook office 20 January 1993.  Total debt: $4,188 billion  ', u'\r\nLeft office 20 January 2001.  Total debt: $5,728 billion ', u'\r\nPercent change in total debt:  +37%\r\n', u'\r\nGeorge W. Bush: ', u'\r\nTook office 20 January 2001.  Total debt: $5,728 billion ', u'\r\nLeft office 20 January 2009.  Total debt: $10,627 billion ', u'\r\nPercent change in total debt:  +86%\r\n', u'\r\nBarack Obama:  ', u'\r\nTook office 20 January 2009.

In that regard, one could find a number of aspects to take issue with:\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a case of relatively accurate information which is of marginal value due to a lack of proper comparative context.\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 23 January 2012\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

The bulk of his education (his final three years at Harvard and an additional four years of law school) did not take place until after his discharge from the Army.\r\n', u'\r\n4.

Athletes look to gain an edge wherever they can, and the ethics of sport often come in a limping second to the desire to win. Those who have devoted their lives to becoming the best often have to face a hard choice ', u" the drugs and use the underhanded methods that will make them the fastest and strongest on the day of competition, or remain drug-free and unmeddled with and watch another competitor take home the gold. And it's hard to set aside a lifetime's worth of work, desire, and hope all in the name of remaining pure. Purity doesn't get your picture on the cereal box; winning does.\r\n", u'\r\nMany of the cheating methods are undetectable, which makes the choice to remain free of such tampering even more difficult. It would be so easy for athletes to remain pure if they knew that they would be caught if they did otherwise and that their strongest rivals would likewise have to foreswear performance enhancers or else be turfed out too. But that is far from the case ', u" tests can be beaten, and some of the tricks of the trade won't show up on any test, no matter how sophisticated. \r\n", u'\r\nBlood doping is such a procedure. The red oxygen-carrying blood cells are drawn from the body several weeks or months before a competition with the plan of reintroducing them at a key moment, thereby super-enriching the blood in time for a particular event.  Because the body has replaced the missing blood in the interim, the reintroduction of the stored blood saturates or "dopes" the bloodstream, elevating performance. Its greatest benefits accrue to those in endurance sports such as cycling or cross-country skiing. There\'s nothing to test for because the super-enriched blood is entirely the athlete\'s own ', u' chemicals are involved, so nothing shows up in scans for drugs or synthetic traces of unknown substances. \r\n', u"\r\nAll this brings us to the question of abortion doping, the notion that female athletes can supercharge their bodies through aborting a fetus just before competition and reabsorbing into their own systems the additional hormones the pregnancy produced. Akin to blood doping, the object is to increase the presence of a natural substance in the athlete, but in this case, it's hormone levels that are being boosted, not the red blood count.\r\n", u'\r\nAs gruesomely unbelievable as this must sound, there is some reason to believe such a procedure might exist.\r\n', u"\r\nAbortion doping was the topic of debate at the First Permanent World Conference on Anti-Doping in Sport held in Ottawa in 1988. According to delegates' statements from that conference, some Eastern European female athletes were having themselves artificially inseminated, then aborting the fetuses two or three months later to take advantage of a perceived hormone boost. Names were not named and specifics were not given, but this was one of the topics under discussion.\r\n", u"\r\nIs it lore, or is it real? At this point, it's impossible to make a definitive call. The delegates could have been repeating baseless scuttlebutt they'd heard from others ", u" was a conference devoted to the evils of performance enhancement in sport, after all, and this story showcased those evils as little else could. On the other hand, they could have been reporting on cases they'd had actual firsthand knowledge of. Without a name, a date, and a checkable medical history, any and all claims that this was in fact going on have to be viewed with \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nskepticism.\r\n', u'\r\nYet it is also true that one of those making the claims was then-International Olympic Committee vice-president Prince Alexandre ', u' of Belgium. He supported stories that some Eastern European athletes do get artificially inseminated and then abort about two or three months into the pregnancy in an attempt to enhance their athletic performance. The prince said a Swiss doctor was the first to implement the practice of abortion as a way to improve sports results, although it was unclear what beneficial effect it has on women other than changing their hormone profile. The practice was not illegal, and ', u' said the IOC would not be policing motherhood. \r\n', u"\r\nIt's possible one grain of truth might have been converted by gossip into a false tale. Underage East German athletes were pressured in the 1970s and 1980s to abort, not because anyone was trying to supercharge them with hormones, but because these unfortunate girls had been subjected to heavy regimes of steroids and other harmful drugs. Had they carried to full term, they likely would have delivered malformed or otherwise handicapped children. One former national back stroke swim champion gave birth to a son who had a clubfoot, and another produced a blind daughter.\r\n", u'\r\nDoctors who were part of the East German sports machine of those days have since been tried and found guilty of having aided and abetted actual bodily harm against the youngsters in their care. For the most part, their punishment has amounted to being assessed a fine.\r\n', u"\r\nCould it be that the reality of East German coaches' forcing their charges to have abortions rather than carry to full term children likely to be born afflicted has been changed through the process of gossip into Svengalis arranging the pregnancies and abortions as part and parcel of an intentional plan to increase hormone levels in those girls? We do have examples of coaches ordering their athletes to abort, although the reason for that command is different; thus one key element of the rumor is in place. It's a theory worth considering, especially in light of the lack of women we can point to who were supposedly killing off their unborn children just to get an undetectable hormone boost.\r\n", u'\r\nIn any event, unless and until someone with a checkable medical history steps forward and says, "Yes, this happened to me," it\'s all unproven speculation, no matter how many sources repeat the tale. It\'s thus premature to mourn for the unborn babies that were conceived solely to enhance their mothers\' athletic performance, because there might not have been any.\r\n', u'\r\nBarbara "straight dope" Mikkelson\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 8 September 2007\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n\xa0\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n'] @@@

The people of Cincinnati (or at least ", u' of those who voted in favor of the "no special protection for gays" measure in 1993), chose to override their City Council on this decision, at least as far as homosexuals were concerned, by exempting those who might lay claim to having been discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation from protection under than ordinance.
