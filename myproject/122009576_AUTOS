At the end of the pickup tube in the gas tank is a "sock" that blocks solid materials, so the fuel gets through, but precious little that\'s not liquid does. Further up the line is the fuel filter, and what may have got through the "sock" does not get past it.\r\n', u"\r\nYet, even though the sugar will not reach the engine in either syrup or solid state, it can clog the fuel filter or the fuel injectors, a circumstance which could stop a car. A little sugar in the tank could be dealt with by no more than having to change the fuel filter a few times, but a heavier sugaring would require the gas tank be removed from the car and dumped out. Tom and Ray Magliozzi (the hosts of radio's ", u") say it's not a big job for a good mechanic to drop the tank and clean it out; the process would likely cost the car's owner somewhere between $100 and $200. Though $100 to $200 is an appreciable sum, it is a far cry from the wished-for outcome of forcing the victim to have to replace the engine or scrap the car.\r\n", u'\r\nIronically, there may soon come a day when each of us happily puts sugar in our gas tanks. In 2002 researchers at the University of Wisconsin at Madison \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nhappened upon a relatively easy way to extract hydrogen from a glucose solution: heat the sugar solution to ', u' and pass it over a platinum-based catalyst to break it down into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The resultant hydrogen could then be directed into a fuel cell that would power a car, with the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.\r\n', u"\r\nThe potential for using sugar to fuel cars doesn't end with the notion of using the hydrogen extracted from glucose solutions. In 2004 researchers at Sandia National Labs began applying for patents covering ways to convert the glucose itself into energy, with an eye to using the sugar itself as a fuel source.\r\n", u'\r\nYet the science of the matter aside, we expect reports of sugared gas tanks to continue to appear on police blotters everywhere for as long as gasoline engines power cars. The desire for revenge runs strong \u2014 so strong that it will not let such a little thing as facts get in its way.   \r\n', u'\r\nAccordingly, the best way to gain revenge on someone through the "sugar in the gas tank" prank might be to simply play on the belief rather than the reality \u2014 just sprinkle a fair amount of sugar on the ground beneath the opening to the fuel tank of your victim\'s car and leave an empty sugar sack in a conspicious spot near the vehicle.  Then sit back and watch your victim go wild trying to figure out how to deal with all that sugar he assumes is now in his gas tank.\r\n', u'\r\nBarbara "domino sugar theory" Mikkelson\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 This particular revenge scheme has been imortalized in the 1996 Less Than Jake song  "', u'" and has appeared in the 1996 film\r\n', u'.\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 12 March 2011\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

What it is about a cellular phone that could possibly trigger an explosion is difficult to fathom, however.  The claim that the batteries used in a cellular phone can ignite gasoline seems specious, since cellular phone batteries are the same voltage as automobile batteries ', u' but deliver far less current.

We'll take you through it, sorting information from misinformation.\r\n", u'\r\nFor starters, although ', u' Renkes, Executive Vice President & General Counsel of the Petroleum Equipment Institute, did prepare a ', u' of refueling fires which appears on the PEI web site, most of the statements in the text of the circulating message quoted above grossly misrepresent that summary:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAre gas station fires caused by static discharge a real danger to motorists?  As the PEI notes, "the dispensing \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nof gasoline into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle is a safe operation," and  "Americans pump gasoline into their cars between 16 and ', u' times a year generally without incident," but fires related to refueling at gas stations seem to be on the rise, and many of these fires are apparently not the result of the usual causes: open flames (mostly from cigarette smokers), sparks from the engine compartments of automobiles (primarily from drivers refueling cars with their motors running), or a lack of electrical continuity between nozzles and grounded dispensers.  The PEI states that they "don\'t have any definitive answers" about the reasons for this increase, but they\'re trying "to collect information on similar incidents so the industry can get a better handle on the cause(s) of the problem."\r\n', u'\r\nSince virtually all the reported fires not attributable to the usual causes cited above have occurred during exceptionally dry weather, the working theory is that static electricity was the source of ignition.  Why fires touched off by static electricity may have increased significantly of late remains undetermined, however, and groups such as the PEI are investigating several possible explanations:\r\n\r\n', u' \r\n\r\nNews reports of gas station fires caused by static electricity are a mixed bag of claims, warnings, and skepticism.

They might be landmarks as considerable as a house you lived in, a school you attended, or a restaurant you frequented, or as unremarkable as a street sign, a water tank, or a tree.  \r\n', u'\r\nOne such memory of mine is a rather unusual one.  It involves a landmark that lasted only a few days before being destroyed; a landmark I never saw and was too young to be aware of during its short lifespan.  Nonetheless, I grew up hearing the folklore of how it came to be and what happened to it, and studying the tantalizing remnant of its brief existence.\r\n', u'\r\nThe landmark of which I speak was the infamous Pink Lady, a ', u' drawing of a naked woman which mysteriously appeared overnight on a sheer rock cliff above a tunnel on Malibu Canyon Road (one of several canyon passageways through the Santa Monica Mountains connecting the northwest portion of Los Angeles County to the Pacific coast) in October 1966: \r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nThe Pink Lady was the handiwork of Lynne Seemayer (now Lynne Westmore), a 31-year-old secretary from Northridge, California.  Motivated in part by the ugly graffiti adorning the rocks above and around a tunnel four miles north of Malibu \u2014 "[T]he tunnel was an eyesore," she said. "If someone was going to that trouble, why not do something creative?" \u2014 ', u' spent several months planning her art project and preparing her "canvas."  Starting in January 1966, she whiled away several nights each month (on evenings when the full moon provided adequate light) climbing the cliff and, tethered by nylon ropes, erasing the graffiti.  Finally, by August 1966, the cliff face was  sufficiently graffiti-free for her to sketch an outline of her planned drawing, which remained undisturbed (and largely unnoticed) for another two months.  (She had originally hoped to draw a bird, but after she realized that its wings would be obstructed by brush she opted for the more vertical figure of a woman instead.)\r\n', u'\r\nFinally, at ', u' on Friday, ', u' 1966 (another moonlit night), Seemayer began her final assault on the \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ncliff with brushes and paint cans.  By dawn, she had completed her work: a 60-foot-tall painting of a naked, pink-skinned, large-breasted woman with long flowing hair, captured in a running pose with a batch of flowers clutched in her right hand.\r\n', u'\r\nFor the first two days of her existence, the Pink Lady (as she was quickly dubbed) was mostly known only to those who glimpsed her while traveling northbound on Malibu Canyon Road.  But by Monday word of the mysterious, titillating image had spread, and by Tuesday the Pink Lady was receiving widespread coverage in local newspapers and TV newscasts.  She was also deemed to be a serious traffic \r\n\r\nhazard.\r\n', u'\r\nForeseeing potential traffic jams (motorists were already stopping their cars along the road to gaze) and accidents caused by distracted drivers, Los Angeles county officials quickly decided that the Pink Lady had to go.  Early eradication efforts failed spectacularly: firefighters were unable to wash the Pink Lady away with their high-power hoses, and the liberal application of paint remover only deepened the blush of her pink skin.  (Seemayer had used house paint for her creation, a substance which proved quite difficult to remove.)\r\n', u"\r\nOnly after the county's assault on the Pink Lady began did Seemayer step forward and reveal herself to be the artist behind the work.  (The difficult-to-reach location and subject matter of the painting had led most observers to speculate that its creator was a man.)  As the ", u' Times reported ', u' years later:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nNeither petitions nor injunctions availed in saving the Pink Lady.  On Thursday, ', u' 1966, as onlookers booed in disapproval, county workers blanked out the scarcely five-day-old Pink Lady with ', u' of brown paint.  (The folklore that developed over the years later held that the Pink Lady had been removed only through the recourse of sandblasting her off the cliff face.)\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nAlthough Lynne Seemayer [Westmore] saw some positive results from her efforts (art galleries, for example, quickly offered to show her work), much of the experience proved negative.  She sued ', u' County for ', u' over the destruction of her work and the invasion of her privacy, and the county countersued for about $26,000 to recoup the cost of erasing the Pink Lady and managing the "public nuisance" she created.  (Both lawsuits were thrown out after the court determined the Pink Lady had been painted on private property, and therefore neither party had standing to file suit.)  \r\n', u"\r\nOn the Pink Lady's 25th anniversary, the ", u' Times chronicled some of the negative repercussions of her creation and removal:\r\n\r\n', u' \r\n\r\nIn the end, a sad result for a woman who had not sought to make a monetary profit or a grand political statement, but who had simply felt the urge to create a piece of art \u2014 to "do something that was [her] own."  (Lynne Seemayer professed surprise at the controversy her Pink Lady created; she had even left a rope at the site so that she could go back and touch up her work later.)\r\n', u'\r\nI never saw the unobscured version of the Pink Lady myself.  My childhood landmark was an enigmatic and impenetrable blur that marked the spot where something of interest had once stood, augmented by the often inaccurate and embellished memories of those who knew the Pink Lady during her brief lifetime.

One breakdown in a key lane, or even a simple fender-bender, can cause traffic to back up for miles; fatal accidents or other impediments can close vital roads for hours at a time. \r\n", u'\r\nEvery large city has its "traffic watch," complete with helicopter reporters who spot-check the local freeways and broadcast traffic conditions to commuters through a variety of drive-time radio shows, but ', u' is a special case. Routine traffic updates that mention the nature and \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nseverity of congestion-causing incidents can easily rush through a dizzying array of freeway names and numbers in half a minute, and woe betide the less-than-attentive motorist who misses the key update for the freeway he was planning to take on a morning when something brings traffic to a standstill on that crucial road \u2014 his inattentiveness may strand him for hours.\r\n', u'\r\nMinor accidents and slowdowns are routine and, although annoying, are considered an ordinary part of the commute. But what about the large-scale interruptions; the overturned rig sprawling across three lanes, the five-car injury wreck, the hazardous materials spill, or the bomb threat? \r\n', u'\r\nLos Angeles has a special name for its traffic updates about unforeseen incidents that have caused what will be lengthy lane closures: SigAlerts. The official Highway Patrol definition of a SigAlert is "any unplanned event that causes the closing of one lane of traffic for ', u' or more, as opposed to a planned event like road construction, which is planned separately." SigAlerts are issued by the California Highway Patrol and are broadcast on ', u' radio and television stations, posted on the CHP web site, and signaled to motorists via electronic billboards on the freeways. Sensible folks immediately divert to alternate routes when they hear the dread term "SigAlert" applied to the route they were planning to \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ntake.\r\n', u'\r\nCauses of SigAlerts are many and varied; some tragic, some funny. One of the more unusual SigAlerts was the Tuesday morning in October 1998 when a truck transporting ten tons of pies overturned on the transition from the Harbor to the Hollywood freeways, creating a pastry-coated traffic snarl that stretched for miles.\r\n', u'\r\nThe word SigAlert eventually became a common and familiar term to Southland drivers, even though few of them were aware of its origins or knew what criteria triggered such an alert.  (Los Angeles traffic reporters say the question they\'re most frequently asked is \'What\'s a SigAlert?,\' with the second most-asked question being "What\'s the ', u' lane?")  A genuine SigAlert is called when conditions create an unplanned freeway lane blockage of at least half an hour in duration (which might not sound like much to a nonresident, but we locals know how a spilled tennis shoe in one lane of a freeway can tie up everyone for hours).  Since nearly everyone knew that the term \'SigAlert\' announced major freeway congestion, and the name sounded official, most drivers who gave it any thought simply assumed the word was a shortening of "signal alert."  Other attempts to fathom what the "Sig" portion of "SigAlert" referred to produced some amusing entries, our favorite being the guess that it was an acronym formed from the advisory phrase "stay in garage."  It was a minor mystery that baffled many ', u' for years, as the ', u' noted in 1997:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe answer is that SigAlerts gained their name from the man who developed the technology for speedily gathering and disseminating traffic information, Loyd C. Sigmon.  In 1955, Sigmon was an executive ', u' of AM radio station KMPC in ', u" part of the Golden West Broadcasting network of western radio and TV stations founded by cowboy singing star Gene Autry.  Seeking a way to boost his station's ratings in the face of increasing competition from television, Sigmon came up with the idea of having the ", u' Police Department, who then patrolled Los Angeles freeways and dealt with accidents (functions now primarily handled by the California Highway Patrol), call his station every time a major accident occurred.  Broadcasting alerts of accident-related freeway congestion to listeners, Sigmon reasoned, would give KMPC a competitive edge over both television and other local radio stations.\r\n', u"\r\nUnfortunately, Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker rejected Sigmon's suggestion; he didn't want his officers diverted from their duties by having to phone a radio station to report every freeway accident.  So Sigmon, who had served as radio engineer with the Army Signal Corps in Europe during ", u", put his ingenuity to work and created a device to automate the task.  His invention was a combination of a short-wave receiver tuned to the LAPD frequency and a tape recorder \u2014 when a police dispatcher broadcast an accident-related call to police units, he could push a button that activated the recorder on KMPC's receiver (by transmitting a special tone); the device would record the bulletin and then turn on a red light to signal radio engineers that an alert had been received.  By rebroadcasting these bulletins, KMPC would be able to provide its listeners with traffic advisories far more up-to-the-minute than any competitor's.\r\n", u'\r\nAlthough Sigmon\'s notification system was a technical success, it proved less of a commercial one. Chief Parker insisted that the system was too important to be used for the benefit of a single radio station and required that it be made available to everyone who wanted it.  Sigmon was unable to gain the proprietary advantage he had envisioned for KMPC, nor did he ever profit personally from his invention, but Parker did give him due credit by coining the term "SigAlert" to describe the new high-tech traffic bulletins.\r\n', u'\r\nSigAlerts became part of the Los Angeles driving experience by October 1955. While it is impossible at this time to pinpoint the incident that prompted the first broadcast of the traffic advisory, one of its first major uses took place on ', u' 1956, when a train leaving ', u' Union Station for San Diego derailed downtown and rolled onto its side.  ', u' died in that crash, and 120 were injured. Ironically, the initial SigAlert \u2014 issued as a plea for emergency medical assistance \u2014 drew such a heavy response that all the medical personnel rushing to the scene caused an even greater traffic jam than the train derailment itself.\r\n', u"\r\nSigAlerts are restricted to traffic incidents these days, but in the beginning they were issued about all manner of items of concern: rabid dogs, a dam about to burst, gas leaks, and even an appeal on behalf of a druggist who had made a potentially deadly error in filling one customer's prescription.  Those uses came to end after a SigAlert was issued to announce the collision of two ships in ", u' Harbor; at that point Police Chief Parker stepped in and announced, "We\'re not going to run the traffic for the harbor."\r\n', u'\r\nIn 1993, the ', u' added "SigAlert" to its all-inclusive compendium of the English language, thereby signaling that it had joined "couch potato" as another Left Coast term to make it into the lexicon of everyday life.  These days the term is no longer limited to ', u' or traffic conditions; its use is common in other parts of the USA, and it is often employed to stand for any type of warning or severe condition. Fortunately, ', u' experiences very little in the way of inclement weather, because local wisdom has it that a rainy day practically guarantees a SigAlert or three.\r\n', u'\r\nLoyd Sigmon himself passed away at the ripe old age of 95 in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, on ', u' 2004.\r\n', u'\r\nBarbara "sigging in the rain" Mikkelson\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 29 March 2011\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

(Even at that time, the story proved unverifiable, with the article's writer identifying it as such and passing it along only as an example of a current rumor \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nsweeping through the community.) Since that early sighting of more than half a century ago, the legend has gone on to enthrall audience after audience as each couple of years sees it pop up anew.\r\n', u'\r\nIts origins are as strange as the story itself. Between 1928 and 1935, Charles Nelson Pogue, an inventor from Canada, applied for numerous patents for what he claimed was a new type of carburetor that supposedly completely vaporized gasoline before introducing it to the cylinders, thereby extracting a great deal more energy from the fuel. According to the Pogue patent description, fuel was introduced into the engine in this vaporous "dry" state rather than in the normal droplet-laden "wet" state, thus combining more readily with air, making it burn with far greater efficiency. Better combustion combined with the raising of the engine\'s operating temperature from 160\xb0F to 180\xb0F were said to be responsible for vastly improved fuel economy. \r\n', u'\r\nSo much for the techno-talk. The Pogue carburetor was touted as getting ', u" to the gallon. Glowing reports about this miracle of ingenuity's making a 1,879 mile trip on ", u' appeared in the May 1936 issue of ', u' magazine, reports which Pogue later denied.  A manager of a Winnipeg auto dealership claimed he had driven a Pogue-equipped car ', u' on a gallon of gasoline. A different dealer principal claimed to have driven ', u' on a pint of fuel. \r\n', u"\r\nThe story snowballed onward from those breathless testimonials as one rumor quickly followed on the heels of another. Thieves were reputed to have broken into Pogue's shop and made off with three of his carburetors. There was talk of armed guards and wolfhounds guarding the shop and the now-famous inventor. Wealthy backers (from Winnipeg or Toronto, depending on whom you heard the story from) were rumored \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto be bankrolling Pogue, but the arrangements mysteriously fell through. Ford of Canada was said to have bought the invention outright. All in all it was a very exciting time.\r\n", u'\r\nAlas, one can get by on mere smoke and mirrors for only so long. Those with sense enough to not be deafened by the hyperbole were not long kept at bay with tales of wolfhounds, thieves, and mysterious briefcase-toting moneymen. They wanted to see the carburetor.\r\n', u'\r\nThat, of course, was never permitted.\r\n', u"\r\nNo one reputable was allowed to see the mechanical miracle in action, let alone have a chance to measure its results. After the initial excitement over Pogue's 1936 announcement had faded, more serious types began to openly doubt that the carburetor would work as described.  In the December 1936 issue of ", u' magazine, its engineering editor, ', u' said of a sketch of the Pogue carburetor: "The sketch fails to show any features hitherto unknown in carburetor practice, and absolutely gives no warrant for crediting the remarkable results claimed." Other journalists were beginning to voice similar opinions.\r\n', u"\r\nIn response to calls to put up or shut up, Pogue's miracle carburetor was heard of no more. Faced with the choice of believing someone had made claims his invention couldn't later live up to or that a monied bad guy had bought up a technology to forever keep it off the market, at least some chose to believe the suppression theory. That the carburetor never made it to the public, they said, was proof enough of its existence.\r\n", u"\r\nThose 1930s news stories breathlessly trumpeting Pogue's miracle of technology form the basis of the economical carburetor legend now before us.  As gas prices \r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nfluctuate, our dependence on fossil fuels is driven home time and again. Who wouldn't long for a miracle of engineering that would free us from the tyranny of the gas pump? And thus the groundwork for belief is laid.\r\n", u'\r\nAs sometimes happens in the world of urban legends, desire for something to be true transforms a rumor into certainty that this very thing is fact. Over the years, our legend about a ', u' car has bobbed to the surface in community after community, been debunked in numerous respected publications, and bobbed right back up in the wake of those debunkings. The need to believe in this wondrous technology and the evil car manufacturers who are deliberately withholding it from the market appears too strong to combat.\r\n', u"\r\nA bit of rational thought should be all that's needed to lay this legend to rest. Why would the car manufacturers at all care about keeping such a technological advance away from consumers? Unlike the petroleum companies, they've no vested interest in how much fuel a car uses. An automaker's self interest is best served by getting the newest irresistible technology to the consumer before his competitors do. If any one of them possessed the secret of the ", u" car, he'd have rushed it into production, hoping to beat his competitors to the punch.\r\n", u'\r\nThose who are tempted to believe the Evil Government is responsible for keeping this miracle out of our hands should reflect for a moment on the current state of world politics. The government of the United States would like nothing better than to throw off the yoke of dependence upon foreign oil. A miraculous carburetor would grant that freedom, allowing Americans to continue to enjoy current levels of use without the need to go hat in hand to OPEC or even those dastardly Canadians. The domestic supply would be more than enough.\r\n', u'\r\nThough rarely is this tale told about anything other than a gas-miserly carburetor, this version describes a miraculous lightbulb:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n(Sometimes lore collides with reality: A long-lived ', u' has been burning since 1901 and currently lights a fire station in Livermore, California.)\r\n', u'\r\nBarbara "gasoline allied" Mikkelson\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 The legend about the need to suppress the steam-driven carburetor that can produce ', u' to protect the oil industry surfaces in an episode of the TV series ', u' ("The Foundling: The War Within; original air date ', u' 2014).\r\n', u'\r\n', u' \xa0 26 June 2014\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

Such a scheme would prevent habitually speeding drivers from avoiding detection by learning the locations of speed traps and ordinary photo radar cameras and slowing down in their proximity.  \r\n', u'\r\nThe "camera tracking" scenario raises concerns that citizens might have to defend themselves against citations that do not detail where, when, and by how much they were speeding, and warnings about that possibility circulated widely in 2007 (in the form of a ', u' that ', u' would be using ', u' transponders or RFID chips embedded within vehicle registration stickers to catch speeders).  A similar rumor was floated in ', u' one which claimed Florida would be replacing the call boxes along its interstate highways with cameras which would snap pictures of passing cars and issue tickets to those determined to have passed between two call boxes too quickly for the given speed limit.\r\n', u'\r\nHowever, the implementation of such a system in any state is not imminent.

It has been postulated that red, being an especially eye-catching color, unduly attracts the attention of the highway patrol, therefore even when every car on the road is whipping past at ', u" over the speed limit, it's the rubicund chariots that suddenly discover flashing lights in their rearview mirrors. \r\n", u"\r\nAnother theory has it that a color-prompted optical illusion makes red cars appear to be going faster than they actually are and so works to get them clocked more often by John Law. Color-influenced driver behavior has also been suggested, with the rubious shade of such vehicles working to increase their drivers' breathing and heart rates, which in turn incites those behind the wheel to drive faster without their consciously being aware of having made that decision. Another line of reasoning ties assumptions made about sports cars (that people who own them tend to drive fast) to red's being one of the most popular colors for such vehicles \u2014 if sports cars are ticketed more often, and more sports cars tend to be red, then red cars would earn proportionally more speeding tickets than would vehicles of other \r\n\r\n\r\ncolors.\r\n", u"\r\nThey're great theories, one and all. Problem is, their premise is flawed as it does not appear that red cars get cited for speeding more often than they statistically should.\r\n", u"\r\nWhenever they've been asked about the rumor, police across the U.S. have consistently denied any connection between vehicle color and tickets issued or the allegation that they write up the drivers of red cars more often than they do other motorists. Said ", u' Rouse, a trooper with the Maryland State Police for more than ', u' "You don\'t care about the car\'s color, you care about the violation. If a red car and a green car drive past you and the green car is going ', u' over the speed limit, the driver of the green car is the one who is going to get stopped." Similarly, ', u' Miller of Clearwater, Florida\'s traffic enforcement unit said, "It\'s not the color of the car that matters, it\'s how fast it\'s going."  Likewise, a California Highway Patrol officer we asked about this rumor asserted it\'s drivers doing something different or unusual that catch the eyes of highway patrolmen, regardless of the color of their vehicles.\r\n', u"\r\nBut of course such statements aren't in and of themselves disproof of anything, because police might well not recognize their own bias when it comes to which vehicles they choose to pursue. Yet what those in law enforcement have had to say on this topic over the years finds support in the one and only study (informal or otherwise) we could locate about correlation of car color to speeding tickets. \r\n", u'\r\nIn an attempt to prove or disprove the belief, in 1990 a reporter for the ', u' Times conducted his own smallish survey of which color of cars were getting the most speeding tickets in his area. He first staked out four intersections in the two counties he was studying and made a tally by color of vehicle of the 1,198 cars that went through them. He then leafed through the most recent ', u' citations issued in those two counties to arrive at a count of how many had been issued to each color of car. Last, he compared the two results to see if the resultant percentages closely approximated one another or were badly out of sync.\r\n', u'\r\nHis findings challenged the belief about red cars being dunned with proportionally more of the speeding tickets. Red cars accounted for ', u' of the local vehicle population and about ', u' of the citations for speeding, which is not a significant difference.  Surprisingly, his informal study did reveal certain statistically significant differences, but they had to do with other colors of vehicle.\r\n', u'\r\nWhite cars, which accounted for ', u' of the local vehicle population, received only ', u' of the tickets, which meant such jalopies were cited for their transgressions ', u' than they should have been. This raises a new hypothesis: Rather than red attracting the unwelcome attentions of the highway patrol, perhaps instead it is the case that police tend not to notice white vehicles that are breaking the law.\r\n', u'\r\nGray cars were the ones that gained a greater share of the speeding tickets than they statistically should have: while they accounted for only ', u' of cars on the road, they pulled down ', u' of the tickets issued. On the flip side, silver cars got only ', u' of the tickets, yet they represented ', u' of the car population.\r\n', u'\r\nIn addition to the "earn more speeding tickets than they should" theory, other mistaken beliefs attach to red cars: They are widely thought to be stolen more often or be involved in a greater number of accidents:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThose in the automobile insurance business deny they\'re charging more to insure red cars than comparable vehicles of other colors, and this would not be the case if red cars were more likely to be stolen or involved in accidents. Regarding the belief that a vehicle\'s color drives up its insurance premiums, says Jeanne Salvatore, vice president for consumer affairs for the Insurance Information Institute in New York City: "It\'s not the color, it\'s your driving record." She\'s never heard of any insurance company charging more for red cars. However, rates are often higher for sports cars of any color, as they are more expensive to buy and repair and are stolen more often.\r\n', u'\r\nThe belief that red cars get ticketed more frequently for speeding has led to the development of an urban legend about police officers adapting the billiards game of ', u' to their work:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u' offered the following tongue-in-cheek advice to motorists looking to avoid being bagged in the ', u' game of highway snooker:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nLuckily for all concerned, the BBC then redeemed itself by proffering this eminently sensible suggestion: "Simplest of all, and surely the advice straight-faced coppers would give, is don\'t speed and you won\'t be caught." \r\n', u'\r\nBarbara "unsnookered" Mikkelson\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u' \xa0 In an episode of the television comedy ', u' ("The Euclid Alternative," original air date ', u' 2008), Sheldon insists that he not be given a red car in the simulator provided to teach him driving skills, stating they get more speeding tickets.\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n', u' \xa0 12 June 2014\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

While it can't be definitively disproved, for the following reasons it's likely better regarded as a legend rather than as an account of an actual incident.\r\n", u'\r\nPhoto speed traps or "snap traps" (cameras linked to speed detection devices that automatically photograph vehicles exceeding the speed limit then mail tickets to the owners of those vehicles) react only to the speed of whatever passes before them; they don\'t analyze and react to anything else. They\'re not geared to detect whether a car\'s occupants are wearing seat belts; these cameras merely record visual images of the automobiles that the speed detection apparatus feeding into them has already determined are breaking the law. \r\n', u'\r\nWorking out the rate of speed is relatively easy for these automated devices.   It usually involves no more than a matter of two sets of sensors having been embedded into the road a short distance from one another; if the second array of sensors buried in the roadbed is triggered in too short a timespan after the first, \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nthe machine "knows" the car passing in front of it is exceeding the speed limit, quickly works out the rate of travel, takes a photograph, and generates a ticket. It\'s purely a matter of math; no judgment or evaluation on the part of the machine is required.\r\n', u"\r\nThe detection of who in a car is wearing a seat belt, however, would be quite a different matter. For a snap trap of this sort to work, it would have to quickly analyze a visual image of the car's occupants to note the absence of safety restraints. Given that seat belts come in various colors, as does the clothing people wear, definitively determining that seat belts are not correctly in place would likely be well beyond any current scanning device's capability. Second, drivers and passengers come in all shapes and sizes, which means the position of the belt would be different on one person to the next, further challenging any machine's capabilities. Third, vehicles come in various heights, so a camera correctly aimed to pick off a clear visual image of those riding in a Toyota Prius would be flummoxed by a Hummer.\r\n", u'\r\nA fellow did once get himself five speeding tickets in short order from an automated speed trap, but such result was due to an ill-controlled temper, not machine malfunction.

Numerous motorists have expressed dismay over the cameras not being limited solely to dangerous locations but being used on quite innocuous stretches of road too. Many see the automated ticketing process as nothing more than an exercise in filling the coffers of the local gendarmes. Yet proponents of this ticketing process say it saves lives and automobile fatalities are down in areas where the cameras have been rolling (which runs contrary to what ', u' says yet agrees with an article found at ', u').\r\n', u"\r\nThe legend's theme of joyful circumvention of an attempt to enforce the law underpins other tales, such as ", u' (sober bar patron pretends to be inebriated as he gets into his car so the cops will follow him, leaving his ', u" buddies a clear shot at getting out of the bar's parking lot unchallenged). Even among the non-leadfoots, it's safe to say almost every driver occasionally exceeds the posted speed limit, even if only by a tad. However, prior to the unblinking eye of the camera, the vast majority of such infractions went unpunished because it was relatively rare for them to unfold before members of the constabulary.\r\n", u"\r\nSnap traps have changed that \u2014 no longer is it safe to presume one's transgressions will escape notice. Presence or absence of a police officer is no longer the determining factor; all that matters is how fast one is going. As for how fast is too fast, depending upon how the machines are set, overages of as little as ", u' can trigger the system into issuing speeding tickets. (A reader in Victoria, Australia, reports the machines there are set to permit overages of ', u' (which is ', u' but after that to begin documenting transgressions.)\r\n', u'\r\nIt is this change that has angered motorists \u2014 under such system, not only are average drivers far more likely to end charged with speeding, they are far more likely to be pinched for what they feel to be relatively insignificant violations. Whereas society is wildly in favor of speeders being ticketed into penury, most folks consider "speeders" to be only those rapscallions who zoom down crowded streets or who go rocketing through school zones; otherwise affable fellows who toddle along at ', u" over the speed limit aren't viewed as scoundrels in need of a sharp lesson.  This mindset encourages attempts to get around the system because those who break the law don't see themselves as doing anything wrong. Instead, they blame the technology that is calling them to account, seeing it (and not their unlawful actions) as the culprit. \r\n", u'\r\nInformation about the location of speed cameras is shared widely, with exhaustive lists of where the snap traps are in various communities  being simple to find on the Web. Some people have even taken to shooting at the cameras or otherwise attempting to sabotage them.\r\n', u"\r\nIt is this mindset which leads us back to our story about the purloined plate and the system tricked into issuing tickets to itself. There is a strong desire to get even with that which is seen as overly punishing, which is how speed cameras are perceived. Therefore, the notion of the system being turned on itself is eminently satisfying. Yet it's a hollow satisfaction in that just a bit more thought nets the realization that the tickets generated by the plate's being run through the trap seventeen times on another vehicle would be discarded.

It's for us, the ordinary folk who get pulled over that ", u' time we had a drink on our way home.\r\n', u"\r\nAll imaginary halos and denials aside, none of these tricks work. Pennies held in the mouth no more fool the breathalyzer than would hopping on one foot while reciting the Lord's Prayer. There's nothing magical about the presumed copper content of a one-cent piece that negates the test. (From 1982 on, the U.S. one-cent coin has been ", u" of 97.5% zinc encased in a copper coating.) Likewise, although mints and various other breath treatments are at least somewhat effective at masking the odor of alcohol on the tippler's breath, they do nothing to affect the presence of demon rum in that person's system. In other words, even if the smell is not detectable, the alcohol itself \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nis. \r\n', u"\r\nOlder breathalyzers measured the chemical reaction between the amount of alcohol expelled on the breath and the contents of a vial in a breathalyzer machine. Newer machines measure breath alcohol by the process of infrared absorption, which entails passing an infrared light wave through a sample chamber containing the subject's breath, then measuring the drop in the intensity of the light and using that to calculate the amount of alcohol in the subject's breath. It's important to delay the test for ", u' after the person being examined has had a drink else "mouth alcohol" might interfere with the results. (Traces of booze generally remain in the mouth for 10 to ', u' after a drink is taken. The ', u' deprivation period allowed for this to dissipate.) \r\n', u"\r\nAdditionally, many police officers assert breathalyzer results can be compromised by the subject's burping while being tested (which they believe would increase the presence of mouth alcohol). That belief is more lore than science: According to a 1992 study performed at the Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, belching had no effect on breathalyzer results. In one study subjects belched and blew into the instrument ", u' after taking a drink of alcohol; the reading was recorded then compared to another reading taken one minute later. There was no difference. Even when people would bring up a belch of gas directly into the instrument, there was no effect. \r\n', u'\r\nFolks have done many strange things over the years in an effort to beat the machine. In a case heard in an Alberta courtroom in March 1985, 28-year-old Dave Zurfluh, who was stopped on suspicion of driving while under the influence, ate his undershorts in the belief they would soak up the excess alcohol in his system. According to Constable Bill Robinson, the arresting officer, he heard "some ripping and tearing" from the back of the cruiser. "I looked in the back and he was tearing pieces of the crotch of his underwear out and stuffing them in his mouth," Robinson testified. \r\n', u"\r\nWe've no idea if the eating of the shorts was what got him off, but Dave Zurfluh was acquitted of all charges because he'd blown .08 on the breathalyzer, the legal limit.\r\n", u'\r\nIn March 2005 a 59-year-old accused drunk driver in Ontario tried to foil a police breathalyzer by stuffing his mouth full of feces. He had been taken to the police station for testing, where he grabbed a handful of his own waste "and placed it in his mouth, attempting to trick the breathalyzer machine," said ', u" Buchanan of the South Simcoe Police. It didn't work. The machine registered two readings of intoxication from samples the suspect provided. Both were more than twice the legal limit. \r\n", u'\r\nAs for the "penny" canard, that too has been tried in real life. In August 2000, one East Hampton man pulled over for drunk driving was discovered to be sucking on a penny when approached for a breathalyzer sample. His speech was slurred, he couldn\'t stand up straight, and he failed all the standard sobriety tests, yet still he had faith in the "penny under the tongue" trick to save the day. \r\n', u'\r\nThe notion that "smell of booze equals booze itself" fuels the erroneous belief that breath improvers are effective counters to the breathalyzer test. Possibly in an attempt to cash in on this confusion, in 1997 a British company began marking "Breathalyzer Blitz," mints advertised for their ability to rid breath of alcohol odors. The spokespeople for Blitz Design Corp. were always upfront in their denials that their mints would negate breathalyzer test results, but the name of the confection itself might well have misled many into believing these particular candies would have that effect.\r\n', u'\r\nAlso, those whose tipple of choice was Zima (a sweet colorless beverage especially favored by the younger set) were often under the mistaken impression that the booze in that particular concoction was not detectable via breathalyzer examination. Because Zima leaves little smell on the breath, its devotees concluded the alcohol contained in the beverage itself would prove similarly hard to pin down. They were wrong, of course, because Zima contained about the same amount of alcohol as ordinary beer, and the breathalyzer would always pick up on that.

Sometimes, though, one's choice of license plate can command an unexpected and undesirable form of attention.\r\n", u'\r\nIn 1979 a Los Angeles man named Robert Barbour found this out the hard way when he sent an application to the California Department of Motor \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nVehicles (DMV) requesting personalized license plates for his car.  The DMV form asked applicants to list three choices in case one or two of their desired selections had already been assigned.  Barbour, a sailing enthusiast, wrote down "SAILING" and "BOATING" as his first two choices; when he couldn\'t think of a third  option, he wrote "NO PLATE," meaning that if neither of his two choices was available, he did not want personalized plates.  Plates reading "BOATING" and "SAILING" had indeed already been assigned, so the DMV, following Barbour\'s instructions literally, sent him license plates reading "NO PLATE."  Barbour was not thrilled that the DMV had misunderstood his intent, but he opted to keep the plates because of their uniqueness.\r\n', u'\r\nFour weeks later he received his first notice for an overdue parking fine, from faraway San Francisco, and\r\nwithin days he began receiving dozens of overdue notices from all over the state on a daily basis.  Why? Because when law enforcement officers ticketed illegally parked cars that bore no license plates, they had been writing "NO PLATE" in the license plate field.  Now that Barbour had plates bearing that phrase, the DMV computers were matching every unpaid citation issued to a car with missing plates to \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n', u'\r\nBarbour received about 2,500 notices over the next several months.  He alerted the DMV to the problem, and they responded in a typically bureaucratic way by instructing him to change his license plates.  But Barbour had grown too fond of his plates by then to want to change them, so he instead began mailing out a form letter in response to each citation.  That method usually worked, although occasionally he had to appear before a judge and demonstrate that the car described on the citation was not his.\r\n', u'\r\nA couple of years later, the DMV finally caught on and sent a notice to law enforcement agencies requesting that they use the word NONE rather than NO PLATE to indicate a cited vehicle was missing its plates.  This change slowed the flow of overdue notices Barbour received to a trickle, about five or six a month, but it also had an unintended side effect: Officers sometimes wrote MISSING instead of NONE to indicate cars with missing license plates, and suddenly a man named Andrew Burg in Marina del Rey started receiving parking tickets from places ', u' hadn\'t visited either.   Burg, of course, was the owner of a car with personalized plates reading "MISSING."\r\n', u'\r\nNonetheless, some motorists still choose personalized plates destined to land them in similar trouble.

His guest backs his claim that he doing only the speed limit, and the pair are waved on their way unticketed. Upon arriving at the hitchhiker's destination, Maskerlyne is thanked by the hitchhiker, who then pushes two fat wallets into his hands and takes off.

Just outside of Ossining, NY, Miller picks up a hitchhiker who soon afterwards tells him he\'s just completed a ten-year stretch for robbery in Sing Sing. Miller floors it and gets nabbed by a policeman, who writes him a ticket instead of arresting him (which had been Miller\'s hope).

Yet non-nut that it is, it is a beloved foodstuff.\r\n", u"\r\nIt's also unlucky. Or least, so says a widely believed superstition within the motor racing world. Many NASCAR drivers have a strong aversion to peanuts in the shell, even barring their presence from their pits. (Peanuts disrobed from their shells appear to be okay with most drivers, however.)\r\n", u'\r\n\r\n\r\nThis especially odd superstition is rumored to have its roots in one of two open-cockpit racer wrecks that took place in 1937. Those who attempt to explain the belief say peanut shells were subsequently found in the cockpits of the drivers who died in those crashes or, alternatively, these shells were afterwards discovered embedded in the grilles of the death cars.\r\n', u'\r\nThe first wreck happened on ', u" at Pennsylvania's Langhorne Speedway during the feature race on that day's card. In an attempt to take over second place during the ", u' race, Frank Bailey swerved to avoid hitting a car driven by Bud Henderson, then crashed into the outer fence on which a number of spectators were seated. Just scant moments before, Henderson had hit two spectators who were attempting to cross the track to the infield.  Three spectators died in that melee, and four other persons were injured, including one driver, Frank Bailey.\r\n', u'\r\nThe second multi-car crash of 1937 took place on ', u' during the ', u' of the  ', u' sweepstakes race at the state fair in Nashville. While there is confusion about whether four or five cars were involved in this crash, there is no doubt about what happened or the result. The car in the lead (which had lapped the one then in second place) began skidding and collided with the machine beside it. Two (or three) other vehicles, which had been close on the heels of the second-place car, rammed into the two cars piled up in front.  Only one person died in this mess, veteran dirt track racer Howard (Howdy) Cox. No one other than the drivers involved in the wreck were injured; unlike the accident at Langhorne, no spectators were harmed.\r\n', u'\r\nNews coverage of both accidents fails to mention anything about peanuts, either about their hulls being found in the \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ncockpits of crashed cars, or intact peanuts being harvested from their grilles.\r\n', u"\r\nSubsequent to these deadly events, a rumor that peanut husks had something to do with either or both of these accidents began to circulate. Different backstories to the belief about ill luck brought about by peanut shells have been given, one asserting the shells were found in the cockpits of the crashed cars, one stating a Philadelphia newspaper published a photo of one of the wrecks in which one could see a peanut wedged in the car's grille, one claiming an anonymous scheming driver attempting to sabotage the race sprinkled his rivals' cars with peanut shells, with the cars he so baptized afterwards crashing into one another. \r\n", u"\r\nAlternatively, credit for the rumor has been laid at the feet of Junior Johnson (of NASCAR fame in the 1950s and 1960s). Supposedly, one of his crew was eating peanuts when an engine blew, the coincidence resulting in blame's attaching to the goobers. Others assert mechanics in the 1930s would routinely find peanut shells from the nearby grandstands in the cylinders of engines that had failed. \r\n", u'\r\nErgo, while the superstition is well established, the reason for it is not. \r\n', u'\r\nIt is known, however, that this proscription against peanut shells and race cars antedates 1937, which rules out both fatal multi-car accidents of that year as the beginning of this myth. A 1933 newspaper article about superstitions held by race car drivers reported that, "Vernon Orenduff, the New Jersey black-headed motor maniac, \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nrefuses to race should a peanut shell drop in his seat." The caption under the photograph that headed the article read, "If you want to make Vern Orenduff, above auto racer, mad at Saturday\'s auto races at the Spartanburg Fair, just get near his Miller race car Saturday with some peanuts."\r\n', u'\r\nYet there is a tie to at least one of those 1937 accidents. Vern Orenduff (of peanut-hating fame) was one of the drivers involved in the ', u' 1937 crash in Nashville in which Howard Cox was killed.\r\n', u"\r\nIt's possible this one driver's personal superstition about peanuts and their shells was pointed to as the cause of the fatal 1937 accident in which he was involved, perhaps by someone's afterwards remembering Orenduff's strong conviction about goobers bringing bad luck. Were that the case, one man's particular bugbear became magnified into an entire sport's b\xeate noire.\r\n", u"\r\nRace car drivers are a superstitious bunch, which is not surprising given the capricious danger of the sport. So very little stands between drivers and death, with the smallest of errors or mechanical malfunctions serving to send cars flying off the track and those behind their wheels to eternal rest. Charms and proscriptions have long been mankind's way to attempt to ward off bad luck in perilous situations, which is why it's unusual to find a race car driver who lacks at least one protective ", u' ritual, good luck piece, or deliberate avoidance of a specific item believed to be unlucky.\r\n', u'\r\nAmong NASCAR drivers of the 2000s, superstitions and rituals abound.

They've proved to be a big hit, making it easier for the grocery-laden to unlock their cars and sparing many of the terminally forgetful from finding they've left their keys in the ignitions of their now-locked vehicles or their purses on the seats of same. \r\n", u'\r\nThe earliest RKE systems were quite vulnerable to the sort of attack described in the warning ', u' quoted above. Their ', u" (usually built into key fobs) sent unique identifying codes that could be picked off by 'code grabbers,' devices that recorded the codes sent out when drivers pushed buttons on their remote key fobs to lock or unlock their cars.\r\n", u'\r\nHowever, times change and technology advances. In response to the fixed code security weakness, automakers shifted from RKEs with fixed codes to systems \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nemploying rolling random codes. These codes change every time a given RKE system is used to lock or unlock car doors and thus rendered the earlier 'code grabbers' ineffective.  That form of more robust code system became the industry standard for remote keyless entry systems in the mid-1990s, so automobiles newer than that are not vulnerable to being quickly and easily opened by criminals armed with the first generation of code grabbers.\r\n", u'\r\nIt is theoretically ', u" for a thief armed with the right technology and the ability to manipulate it correctly to snatch a modern keycode from the air and use it to enter a vehicle.  However, it's unclear how many (if any) crooks have managed to overcome the issues of complexity and time involved in the process to use it as a practical means of stealing from cars.  If the scheme requires would-be thieves to have specialized knowledge and equipment and spend hours (or more) crunching data and replicating a device to produce a correct entry code, its application to boosting valuables from cars in parking lots would be rather limited.  As Microchip Technology, the manufacturer of ", u' brand RKE systems, noted of this possibility: \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nSo far we haven't encountered any documented cases of items being stolen from locked cars via entry gained through the use of code grabbers, much less evidence that it's a widespread form of theft.

Although these accounts are probably "real" in the sense that they  indeed reflect someone\'s attempt to describe an automotive mishap that actually happened to him, the explanation about a hydroplaning car\'s suddenly accelerating and "taking off like a rocket" due to the use of cruise control is a garbled one probably reflecting the author\'s misunderstanding of what had occurred. \r\n', u"\r\nNonetheless, the warning inherent to the tale \u2014 don't engage your vehicle's cruise control on slippery or wet roads \u2014 is well worth heeding.  Snow, ice, slush, or even rain can cause wheel-spin and loss of control, situations to which drivers must react quickly.   Although cruise control can generally be cut off by the driver's simply tapping the brake pedal, the extra reaction time required for a motorist relying upon cruise control to recognize the danger of the situation when his wheels begins to spin or slide on a slippery surface, bring his foot up off the floor to the brake pedal, and disengage the cruise control can be crucial (especially for drivers lured into a hazardous level of inattentiveness on long, flat stretches of road).\r\n", u"\r\nAccording to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia's ", u' of tips about driving on wet roads:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAn example from the weekly "Drive It Forever\'\' automotive column by ', u' Times Syndicate writer Bob Sikorsky provides a description of one such occurrence:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nWet-road driving is fraught with dangers that are not always immediately apparent. Just a thin layer of water lying on pavement can send an unsuspecting car hydroplaning into another lane \u2014 the car's wheels skim along the water's surface instead of making contact with the road. Also, roads constantly accumulate oily substances loosed by car exhaust, and this residue settles deep into the pavement. Rain brings this oil back to the surface, making roads especially slippery during that first hour of downpour or misting.\r\n", u'\r\nLikewise, winter driving carries with it a similar set of perils. Ice, snow, and sleet can make for dangerously slippery conditions, but so too can innocuous-looking slush and all-but-invisible "black ice."
