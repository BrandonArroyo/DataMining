I never thought this guy would be the only one!" Within days, the video had been shared millions of times.\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nWhile the footage tugged at many heartstrings, its creators were somewhat upfront about its staged nature. Dubbing the video a "social experiment," its publishers admitted that the child was neither legitimately homeless nor freezing in a manner that was anything more than incidental and deliberate. They claimed the "social experiment" (a term often used to excuse a number of unpleasant or deceitful \r\n\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nbehaviors through the premise of illustrating a point) was designed to prove that the citizens of New York City would not be moved by the child's hypothetical plight, even in unusually cold weather. \r\n", u'\r\n\r\nSeveral aspects of the story were shaky, implausible, or simply far too scripted. First, the viral video producers claimed that the child was exposed for two full hours in what appeared to be a busy area of midtown Manhattan in broad daylight, wearing only a thin ', u' and shivering violently. However, the New York Police Department aggressively ', u' the streets of the city for ', u" homeless individuals. Such measures are stepped up in adverse weather conditions, and the scenario beggars belief when mitigating factors are examined: a minor child, lacking a jacket in extreme cold, left alone on the street in Manhattan's busiest district.", u'\r\n\r\nA webpage for NYC.gov explains the precautions undertaken by the city in such circumstances:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nThe second shaky factor was the other content published by OrkTv prior to their "freezing, homeless child stunt": All were clearly manufactured for maximum social media interest, and their focus was neither charitable nor honest. (The words "prank" and "social experiment" appeared frequently in connection with that work.) In the same vein, the video\'s conclusion involved a fellow homeless person stepping up to help where no one else would. (The man was then purportedly awarded $500 for his convenient-to-the-narrative compassion.)\r\n', u"\r\nThe third factor was that the video was tied to an IndieGogo page purportedly created to raise funds to provide clothing for New York City's homeless population. That page was operated by OckTV and lacked any specific detail about how the funds raised would be managed, accounted for, or meaningfully used to assist homeless individuals in New York. And while the campaign could have been on the ", u' it was slated to close on ', u" 2015, well past the brunt of winter's unpleasantness in the city. No explanation was given on the page regarding whether the funds collected would be held until the next winter rolled around or repurposed to otherwise assist homeless people at the conclusion of the campaign.", u'\r\n\r\nSo while the video depicted a child on the streets of New York City in what looked to be very cold weather, little else about it was honest or straightforward. There are a number of legitimate, vetted ', u" in New York City dedicated to assisting vulnerable and needy people, and those moved by the video's staged events would do better to donate to one of them. \r\n", u'\r\n\r\n', u' \xa0 27 February 2015\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n'] @@@

In films and television programs, automobile crashes are always slam-bang affairs that inevitably end with one or more cars bursting into flame and exploding; thunder is always a very loud, sharp, and short report which occurs simultaneously with a bolt of lightning (rather \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nthan a slow, distant, gradually increasing rumbling which arrives well after the lightning flash); and gunshots are usually depicted as producing ear-splitting volumes of sound and, when aimed at another human being, resulting in plenty of gore and splatter.\r\n', u"\r\nIt's no wonder, then, that when the above-displayed video of a detainee shooting himself while in police custody began to circulate, many viewers were skeptical of its ", u" Hollywood standards, it's so tame as to be almost surreal.   As depicted in the video, an uncuffed suspect enters an interrogation room and sits down in a chair, followed by an officer who dumps some keys and sunglasses on a table, checks his cell phone, and leaves the room momentarily.  The officer returns several seconds later with a bottle of water and a cup of coffee, then hands the water bottle to the suspect, checks his cell phone again, picks up the coffee, and exits the room a second ", u' the suspect alone and unrestrained, and the door open.  The suspect takes a couple of swigs of water, then calmly reaches into his pants with his other hand, pulls out a large-caliber handgun, and shoots himself in the left temple.\r\n', u'\r\nBut what we see in the video is nothing like what most of us might expect.  The soon-to-be suicide victim is neither visibly nervous nor distraught as he freely pulls out a gun and places it against his head.  (He even replaces the cap on the water bottle before pulling the trigger.)  The weapon does not produce an ear-shattering concussive \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nsound in the small room, blood and brain matter don't splatter all over the walls, and the victim's body isn't hurtled out of the chair and onto the floor.  The gun makes a sharp popping sound as the suspect shoots himself, blood streams from the victim's head and mouth, his hands drop the gun and water bottle to the floor, and his body slumps but slightly in the chair.\r\n", u'\r\nEven more unusual to many viewers is the officer\'s reaction to this event.  He doesn\'t respond with any of the emotions most of us might feel, such as fear, panic, terror, or disgust.  Nor does he rush to the victim\'s aid, check him for signs of life, summon help, or otherwise raise an alarm.  "Oh, fuck," he exclaims as he ', u' the room, puts his coffee down on the table, and surveys the scene for a second or two, then adds "Holy fuck."  When a second (unseen) officer inquires  "What did he do?" he responds with, "Nobody shook him" (i.e., nobody searched the suspect for weapons), then calmly retrieves the keys and sunglasses and leaves the room.  Throughout the short video, the officer\'s actions seem almost nonchalant: he doesn\'t act the least bit shocked or horrified that a human being has just died a violent death right in front of him. Instead, the foremost thought on his mind seems to be concern that someone\'s going to get into big trouble for the oversight of allowing a detainee to retain a weapon.\r\n', u"\r\n(We realize, of course, that all of this would be viewed quite differently from a police perspective.  Officers undergo thorough instruction in the handling and use of firearms, they generally see far more blood and violence on the job than most of us will experience in our lifetimes, and they're trained to respond to emergency situations by following proper procedure rather than reacting with fear or panic.  We're simply presenting the average person's reaction to this video, as reflected in the ", u" we've received from readers who have viewed it.)\r\n", u'\r\nThe circumstances behind this video took place on 19 December 2003, when 47-year-old Ricardo Alfonso Cerna was stopped for a traffic violation at about ', u' in Muscoy (a residential suburb of ', u' County, about ', u' east of ', u"  Cerna fled the scene (in his car and then on foot) before shooting the pursuing officer, sheriff's deputy Michael Parham, twice in the abdomen.

Evidently a chain of mistakes led to Cerna, a shooting suspect, being taken into custody without either the arresting officers or the booking officers discovering he had a large, heavy handgun concealed on his person:\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\n(This apparently egregious oversight led to conspiracy-theory speculation in some quarters that Cerna had been "', u'" by the ', u" Sheriff's Department, or that the sheriff ", u' the gun to Cerna and urged him to commit suicide with ', u" completely implausible scenario of officers' deliberately handing a loaded gun to a suspect who had already shot one policeman notwithstanding.)\r\n", u"\r\nAs to how the video of Cerna's suicide made it onto the Internet, sheriff's spokesman Chip Patterson said:\r\n\r\n", u"\r\n\r\nSheriff's officials do not know who might have leaked the video to the public.

Prior to its appearance on the web sites of ', u', ', u', ', u' and ', u', the ', u" article casting doubt on the veracity of a giant hog's being shot on a Georgia plantation had not circulated in cyberspace.\r\n", u'\r\nDatelined Alapaha, Georgia, the ', u' 2004 ', u' article advised readers to remain somewhat skeptical of the tale because its writer had been unable to verify the size or weight of the hog, or indeed any of the other details given in the account. Only \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\ntwo people supposedly saw the beast: its slayer, and the owner of the property where it was downed. Chris Griffin, the hog's slayer, said he and Ken Holyoak, the owner of the River Oak Plantation, buried Hogzilla on the property. The photograph was taken sometime in June 2004 near Alapaha, a town with a population of 682.\r\n", u'\r\nHolyoak claimed that because he couldn\'t fit the huge animal in his freezer intact, and its meat was not suitable for eating, he and his crew decided to bury it instead.  He maintained they cut off the head (described by Holyoak as "about as big as a car tire") and interred it separately from the rest of the hog\'s remains in an undisclosed location because they were feared someone would try to steal it.  Nonetheless, there was reason to doubt the claim of the hog\'s weighing a thousand pounds \u2014 not only aren\'t feral hogs known to grow to that size, but one has to wonder how the killer of this particular ground-rooter came by the ', u" figure. It's not as if folks routinely port about scales capable of weighing something that large, and according to the AP account, the hog was never dragged to any location where it could have been weighed. \r\n", u'\r\nFarm-raised hogs, however, have been known to grow to sizes even larger than that claimed of Hogzilla:\r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nAlthough the photograph is real, it contains clues to a bit of exaggeration in the telling of this tale: the man pictured beside the strung-up hog is standing in an area that has been dug up. Once one accounts for the remainder of the man's legs (which are hidden from view in the pit) and \r\n\r\n", u'\r\n\r\nmentally compares the complete figure with the suspended hog, the claim of the beast\'s being "nearly twice as long as the 6-foot-tall Griffin" collapses, because the human figure comes up only a bit shorter than that of the felled animal. \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\nAlso, items placed in the foreground of photos tend to look larger than they are, and in this picture the man is standing to the rear of the hog. The beast, therefore, looks bigger in comparison to the man than it would if the two had been snapped side by side.  Indeed, when the National Geographic Society sent a team of scientists to exhume Hogzilla, what they found was not a 12-foot behemoth of a hog, but an animal they estimated had measured about ', u' feet in length and weighed around ', u' \u2014 a hybrid of wild boar and domestic Hampshire pig that the ', u' described as "large, perhaps even record-setting large, but not hide-the-children-and-get-your-guns large."\r\n', u'\r\nMay 2007 brought both the announcement that an independent filmmaker was planning to produce a horror movie about the monster porker (to be entitled ', u') and the claim that an 11-year-old Alabama boy had killed a hog even bigger than the renowned super swine:\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\nAccording to various news reports, on 3 May 2007 near Delta, Alabama, 11-year-old Jamison Stone used a pistol to shoot and kill a wild hog weighing a staggering ', u' and measuring an incredible ', u' from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail \u2014 measurements which, if documented, would make the creature considerably larger than Hogzilla.

For the creation of body art (also known as mehndi), henna is mixed into a paste with essential oils (or purchased in the form of ready-made henna cones) and applied to the skin in intricate patterns.  When left on the skin for at least four hours, the paste produces patterns akin to \r\n\r\n', u'\r\n\r\ntattoos (albeit temporary ones).

One method of raising much-needed revenue has been the implementation of various agritourism schemes, such as leasing land for hunting and fishing, giving tours, or charging tourists to spend a day (and night) on the farm.    Another popular agritourism scheme (one which Barbara and I have experienced personally, at the cost of many aching muscles) is the conversion of corn fields into large, elaborate ', u', which hapless tourists fork over dollars for the privilege of wandering through for hours on end (also known as "solving" the maze).\r\n', u'\r\nWhen Jon Rose of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, decided to bring in some money by creating a maize maze on his farm for the second straight year in 2002, he went whole hog.

Every state of the U.S. has laws governing who can transport dead bodies and how they can be disposed of, and "The husband would like to take his wife\'s corpse home to keep in his coffee table" doesn\'t pass muster in any state, no matter how much a "cemetery caretaker" might sympathize with the bereaved, and no matter what influential "authorities" might grant permission.

Poor Lucy would had to have been treated with some very advanced embalming and \r\n\r\n', u"\r\n\r\nmummification techniques costing many thousands of dollars to preserve her, and even then she still wouldn't look this good.

In a nutshell, "Lucy" is more angelfish than angel.\r\n', u'\r\nThe nail in the coffin for the "Lucy" story is the fact that it originated with the ', u' issue of the ', u', an entertainment tabloid whose stock in trade is the fantastically fictional.

A common misconception has it that embalming preserves corporeal remains for a very long time, possibly even indefinitely. If truth be told, ordinary funeral home practices maintain the deceased in a state of not-too-terrible decomposition for usually about three days to a week, generally just long enough to get through the funeral without the bereaved being confronted with the smell of ongoing decomposition. Embalmed bodies deteriorate just a little bit more slowly than unembalmed ones, but the end result is pretty much the same \u2014 an embalmed body will go the same putrefying way of an untouched one.\r\n', u'\r\nCadavers preserved for medical dissection can be kept viable for about two years, but these are subjected to extraordinary embalming techniques which generally take one to three days to complete.

Likewise, the extraordinary techniques used to preserve Lenin and Peron should be ruled out on their cost  ', u' be well beyond the means of any but the super-rich.
